# Preparing Environment

1. In terminal, unzip `TotalCross-iOSCodesign.zip` and cd  to `TotalCross-iOSCodesign/`.
2. Execute `sudo chmod +x tccodesign.sh xcassetsGenerator.sh`.
3. Install **Imagemagick** by entering command `brew install imagemagick` (if you don't have brew installed visit [this page](https://brew.sh/) and install it. Its pretty easy!).
4. You're ready to use it!

# How to use
To run this script will need:

1. The file `app.ipa` generated by totalcross deployer.
2. The application icon.
3. Mobile provision file: i.e., `app-ad-hoc.mobileprovision`.
4. Certificate name that you can get by double clicking on the certificate you want to use (ex. Iphone Distribution: My Company).
5. 	Method, which can be: `app-store`, `ad-hoc`, `enterprise` or `development`. 

Having all of those parameters, you will be able to run the following command: 
 
```
./tccodesign --ipa path/to/to-be-signed.ipa --icon path/to/icon.png --provision-file path/to/provision-file.mobileprovision --certificate 'IPhone Distribution: XXXX Company YYYYY' -m [ad-hoc | app-store | enterprise | development]

```

This will generate an **Totalcross.ipa** inside `[tccodesign.sh directory]/build`.
