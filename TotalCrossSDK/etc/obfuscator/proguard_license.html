<h2>License</h2>

<b>ProGuard</b> is free. I wrote it for the challenge of it. And for eternal
fame and glory, of course. You can use it freely for processing your
applications, commercial or not. Your code obviously remains yours after
having been processed, and its license can remain the same.
<p>

<b>ProGuard</b> itself is copyrighted, but its distribution license provides
you with some rights for modifying and redistributing its code and its
documentation. More specifically, <b>ProGuard</b> is distributed under the
terms of the <a href="GPL.html">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL), as
published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="other">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF). In short, this means that you may freely redistribute
the program, modified or as is, on the condition that you make the complete
source code available as well. If you develop a program that is linked with
<b>ProGuard</b>, the program as a whole has to be distributed at no charge
under the GPL. I am granting a <a href="GPL_exception.html">special
exception</a> to the latter clause (in wording suggested by the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs"
target="other">FSF</a>), for combinations with the following stand-alone
applications: Apache Ant, Apache Maven, the Eclipse IDE, the Sun NetBeans IDE,
the Sun J2ME Wireless Toolkit, and the Javaground Tools.

<p>
The <b>ProGuard user documentation</b> represents an important part of this
work. It may only be redistributed without changes, along with the unmodified
version of the code.
