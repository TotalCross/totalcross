THE PLATFORM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Welcome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Welcome to TotalCross.
 This tutorial assumes that you know how to write Java programs.
 If not, I suggest that you take a basic course in Java at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/index.html"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you'll have to forget the JDK API and use the TotalCross API.
 Make a good read of the API javadocs: they will show you the differences
 between the JDK and the TotalCross API.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some conventions used in this tutorial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a code sample has ...
 (ellipses) between two parts, it means that some part of that code has
 been omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Measurements are always in 
\emph on
pixels
\emph default
, unless otherwise specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial follows the Object Oriented naming convention: a class containing
 methods (~functions) and properties or fields (~variables).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
TC
\series default
 refers to TotalCross.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
TCVM
\series default
 refers to the TotalCross virtual machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term “
\series bold
main class
\series default
” always refers to the class that extends 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.MainWindow
\family default
 or implements 
\family typewriter
totalcross.MainClass
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term “
\family typewriter
\series bold
%TOTALCROSS_HOME
\series default

\begin_layout Chapter
TotalCross Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you for your interest in TotalCross.
 If you don't know where to start, here's a quick overview of the platform:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Supported Platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Android 2.3.3 and above (API level 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
iOS 5.0 and above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows XP and above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Linux 32 bits (we only assure that it works on Debian distribution).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Browser as Java applet (JDK 1.1 and above).
 Note that in this case you must enable some permission so that you can
 use files and, consequently, Litebase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Java SE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows Phone 8.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Virtual Machine Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross Virtual Machine (TCVM) is a shared library written from scratch,
 and has the following features: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It interprets a proprietary set of opcodes instead of Java Bytecodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a register-based VM, not stack-based as Java, which results in better
 performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has support for real multi-threading.
 Note that the TotalCross API does not supports concurrency, which must
 be implemented by your own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The TotalCross class (
\family typewriter
tclass
\family default
) files stores internal information in little endian, since its the most
 widely used format of actual microprocessors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
tclass
\family default
 files are highly optimized to save space.
 For instance, the constant pool (where strings, constants, and identifiers
 are stored) is shared among all deployed classes, and each class entry
 is compressed using zlib.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports headless applications (like daemon applications, without user interface
): just implement the interface 
\family typewriter
totalcross.MainClass
\family default
 and this class will be loaded by the TCVM.
 The 
\family typewriter
appStarting()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
appEnding()
\family default
 methods are called and the application exits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports the method 
\family typewriter
finalize()
\family default
, ran every time the garbage collector (gc) finishes its job.
 There's a limitation: no objects can be created inside a finally method,
 otherwise the method will silently abort itself.
 Optionally, to improve GC's performance, you can define in your class a
 public non-static field named 
\family typewriter
dontFinalize
\family default
 that, if present and set to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
, will skip the finalize call.
 In most cases, 
\family typewriter
finalize()
\family default
 is used to ensure that a class that holds system resources (like file or
 socket) and should be closed to release these resources is always closed,
 either because the programmer forgot to do it himself or because the program
 was halted by an exception.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"

height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that you must define the field 
\family typewriter
dontFinalize
\family default
 and set it to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 when the close method is run for the first time.
 Otherwise the gc will try to finalize an object that was already closed
 by the programmer, which may cause trouble.
 Doing so also speeds up the gc.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross VM also has a drawback:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It does not support the 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 type, only 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
.
 This option was adopted because all actual PDA processors have a math co-proces
sor, and also because the vast majority of mobile applications are not scientifi
c programs.
 During our research, we found that 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 types are two times faster than double, but this small performance difference
 does not make up for the overhead needed to add 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 type support to the virtual machine.
 The change from 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
 will be done by the translator to let legacy applications work, however,
 you should change your application to use 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
, since there's no benefit by using 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thread support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross supports preemptive threads using the native thread mechanism
 of each supported platform.
 On Android, iOS, and Linux, it uses pthread, and on Windows, it uses the
 quite well documented thread api.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The API does not support concurrency.
 If your program needs to access the same object from many threads, you
 must use the 
\family typewriter
synchronized
\family default
 keyword.
 The support for synchronized is limited: it does not support synchronized
 methods.
 So, you must use the 
\family typewriter
synchronized(object)
\family default
, and it is more efficient to use it with 
\family typewriter
totalcross.util.concurrent.Lock
\family default
.
 Using the
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

synchronized
\family default
 keyword before a method will be useless: it will be ignored by the VM.
 Note that these problems will not occur when running on Java desktop, only
 when running on TCVM.
 Here's a sample that shows how to use it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinputlisting[label=samplecode,caption=A sample]{companion_resources/listings/
TestConcurrent.java}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sample above, commenting out the line marked with *****, the log
 list box will be filled randomly by the threads.
 With the lock, it will be filled in sequence, because each thread will
 gain the lock once, and the other threads will have to wait the main loop
 of the lock owner finish before starting their loops.
 There's no limit in the number of locks used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally speaking, you can create a thread to listen to a socket or a file
 or even a Litebase table in background, but be aware that if you try to
 access the same resource by different threads your application might just
 blow up.
 We also don't recommend running the user interface in a background thread,
 due to system event concurrency.
 Threads should be used for I/O and other tasks, but not for showing user
 interface screens that could receive events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphics, Palette and Color
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has a graphics engine written from scratch, and some important
 performance-tailored decisions were taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the device's color depth, the screen and images are stored
 in a 24 bpp RGB array.
 All drawings are made into a single off screen, which is then converted
 on the fly to the device's screen color depth when the 
\family typewriter
updateScreen()
\family default
 method is called.
 Note that since 2011, no devices with 8 bpp are released to the market;
 all of them use at least 16 bpp (65536 colors).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 class supports real clipping, which allowed us to support containers that
 automatically show scrollbars if components are placed beyond its limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross also supports screen rotation and collapsible input area.
 If the user interface is implemented using only relative coordinates, it
 will automatically reposition itself whenever the screen resolution is
 changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0

special "none"

height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that 
\family typewriter
aControl.setRect(getClientRect())
\family default
 should never be used, otherwise the automatic repositioning will not work.
 Instead, 
\family typewriter
aControl.setRect(LEFT, TOP, FILL, FILL)
\family default
 should be used to produce the same result without affecting the repositioning.
 If you really have to use 
\family typewriter
getClientRect()
\family default
, you must also override the 
\family typewriter
reposition()
\family default
 method to support screen rotation.
 (see the WorldWatch sample).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colors are represented by 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 values in the 
\family typewriter
0xRRGGBB
\family default
 format.
 A 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 color is represented by the value -1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Images in TotalCross supports transparency (also known as alpha-channel).
 The best way to show images is to generate a PNG image from a vectorized
 image through Photoshop or any other good editor.
 Prefer creating a big image (for example, 96x96), then decrease its size
 at runtime using 
\family typewriter
Image.getSmoothScaledInstance
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inheritance and Delegation event models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross supports both Inheritance (Java 1.0) and Delegation (Java 1.1)
 event models.
 However, the usage of the later one is not recommended.
 The Inheritance model will make your code smaller and faster, but there
 are some situations that require the usage of the Delegation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross applications are currently impossible to be decompiled, because,
 as mentioned before, TotalCross uses a proprietary set of opcodes instead
 of Java Bytecodes.
 The translation between Java Bytecodes to TotalCross opcodes is done automatica
lly when the application is deployed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this also means that you cannot retrieve your application's source
 files from the deployed application, so don't forget to backup your source
 files!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be sure to read the API javadocs at 
\family typewriter
%TOTALCROSS_HOME%/docs/html/index.html
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The javadocs and this reference manual are complementary, and the javadocs
 are updated more often than this text.
 So make sure to read them for more information.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some examples in the 
\family typewriter
%TOTALCROSS_HOME%/src/java/tc/samples
\family default
 directories.
 These samples covers the usage of a great portion of TotalCross' class
 library, so it's a good source of information from where you can start
 your applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our official forum (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://forum.totalcross.net"

\end_inset

) is a good place to seek for help from fellow TotalCross users and share
 your knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bug Reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you'd like to report a bug or problem within the TotalCross SDK – including,
 but not limited to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Documentation problems, grammar errors, or typos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TotalCross platform bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sample bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should first take a look at the TotalCross changelog
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "(http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/changelogs.asp)"
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/changelogs.asp"

\end_inset

 and check if your bug was already fixed on a later version of the TotalCross
 SDK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may then use the forum to report the bug, however, its not guaranteed
 that we will fix the bug.
 If you want the bug fixed in a few days and receive a fixed virtual machine,
 you must purchase a support plan
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name " (http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/suporte.asp)"
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/suporte.asp"

\end_inset

 at the site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When opening an issue, it's very important to give all the details so that
 its correction will be faster.
 Here's a rough template of a bug report for TotalCross:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TotalCross version, e.g.
 1.0 beta 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Platform used and OS version, e.g.
 JDK 1.8, Windows XP, Windows Phone 8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Devices used, e.g.
 Android, iPhone, Java Standard Edition (desktop).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Device model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bug description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How to reproduce the bug?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For documentation problems and such, just pointing the resource and the
 problem is enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purchased support can also be used to solve doubts about using TotalCross.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The TotalCross SDK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK Java files are covered by the LGPL version 3.
 By installing the SDK you are agreeing with this.
 The TotalCross virtual machine follows another license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM provided in the SDK is a demo version.
 It will work for 80 non-contiguous hours, regardless of the platform.
 The remaining time is updated every 5 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Android and iOS, it's only necessary to first uninstall and then reinstall
 TotalCross (or your application together with it), so that you will have
 more 80 hours to test.
 This is NOT considered a license violation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Win32 (Windows, XP, Vista, Seven, or 8), this can only be done by reinstallin

\begin_layout Standard
In most situations, you will install several programs that will share the
 same TCVM.
 For instance, you can install 10 or more samples and a single virtual machine.
 However, if you're deploying an application to your costumer, you can package
 the VM with your application, using the 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
's

 In this case, a single package is needed.

\begin_layout Section
Running the Samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK comes with various sample applications along with their
 source code.
 The samples are simple and most of them address a specific feature.
 They were designed to show you the TotalCross main features and to provide
 a starting point for your own applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The built samples can be found on 
\family typewriter
%TOTALCROSS_HOME%/dist/samples
\family default
.
 Just follow the installation instructions from chapter 6 and run the sample
 on your target platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Building and deploying your first TotalCross application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross applications are developed almost exactly like Java applications,
 so anyone familiar with Java should be able to start small TotalCross applicati
ons in a few minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this similarity is often also source of problems, so before writing
 any code, we must first be aware of the differences between Java and TotalCross
 development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The entry point of a TotalCross application is always a class that extends
 the class 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MainWindow
\family default
 (directly or indirectly) or implements the interface 
\family typewriter
MainClass
\family default
.
 It is not possible to directly run TotalCross applications in Java, in
 this case, you must use the launcher provided with the SDK.
 (see Chapter 4 for details about 
\family typewriter
totalcross.Launcher
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For your convenience, the TotalCross package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 is directly mapped to the Java package 
\family typewriter
java.lang
\family default
.
 Therefore, you may refer to classes from this package, such as 
\family typewriter
Object
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
, like you would in any Java application, without requiring any explicit
 import.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately this feature can be misleading, because the opposite is NOT
 true.
 The 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

java.lang
\family default
 package does have members (interfaces, classes, exceptions, or errors)
 that are not available in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 – and some of the members that are available, may not implement all the
 methods provided by the homonymous member.
 Some examples are the 
\family typewriter
Integer
\family default
 class and the method 
\family typewriter
String.replaceFirst()
\family default
, which are not implemented by TotalCross.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one of the most common pitfalls when developing TotalCross applications
 using a Java IDE, because its content assist will show classes and methods
 that are not implemented by TotalCross, and therefore, not available on
 the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this problem, the TotalCross deployer verifies the class files,
 reporting any invalid references found.
 The deployer will throw an exception if you try to deploy an application
 with references to classes not available in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You should also check TotalCross Javadoc to see if the desired 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 reference is available so that you won't have to rewrite parts of your
 program during the deployment process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You CANNOT use nor import 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 package in desktop.
 When 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 is called, all references to 
\family typewriter
java.lang
\family default
 are replaced by 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To use collection classes, the approch is similar for 
\family typewriter
java.lang
\family default
 classes.
 You must use 
\family typewriter
java.util
\family default
 classes and 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 will convert them to the correspondent 
\family typewriter
totalcross.util
\family default
 classes.
 Notice that in this case some fields and methods found in the Java classes
 might also be missing in TotalCross classes.
 Therefore, in this case you must also check the javadocs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TotalCross is compatible only with the Java 1.8 class file format or below,
 therefore the class files MUST be generated targeting the JDK 1.8 and the
 source files must be compatible with JDK 1.8.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If you're compiling using 
\family typewriter
javac
\family default
 from command line (or an ANT file), add this to your command line: 
\family typewriter
-target 1.8 -source 1.8
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using a Java IDE, look for its Java Compiler settings and set
 its compliance level to 1.8.
 But please notice that it might happen that the 
\family typewriter
.class
\family default
 generated by an IDE such as Eclipse is not fully compatible with 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 and an unexpected problem might happen due to this fact.
 If this is the case, try using 
\family typewriter
javac
\family default
 instead (if your program has a lot of classes, use an ANT file to facilitate
 the compilation process).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, the deployer will throw an exception if it detects an invalid class
 file format.

Building a sample application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our first application, let's make a typical “Hello World” application
 using just your preferred plain text editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, make sure you have a JDK installed (preferably the JDK 8) and the
 environment variables are set.
 There should be a JAVA_HOME variable set with the installation path of
 your JDK, like 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
Program Files
\backslash
Java
\backslash
jdk1.8.0_25
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that some Java versions have problem when there is a space in the folder
 name, such as 
\family typewriter
Program Files
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Arquivos de Programas
\family default
.
 If this is the case, just uninstall Java and reinstall it in a folder without
 space in its name.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And another variable named PATH, which should contain a list of paths, separated
 by semicolons, with the path to the JDK's bin directory, like 
\family typewriter
%JAVA_HOME%
\backslash
bin
\family default
.
 If you don't do this, you will get the error: 
\family typewriter
[preverify] JAR file creation failed with error -1
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also add the path to the TotalCross 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file (located in 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist/tc.
 jar
\family default
) to your CLASSPATH environment variable (or create one if the variable
 does not exists).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The usage of the CLASSPATH variable is usually not advised, because it may
 cause conflicts when different classes share the same package structure.
 Creating an ANT build file and using the command line option 
\family typewriter
-classpath
\family default
 is a better choice.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Remember, if you preferred to not use the CLASSPATH variable, you must ALWAYS

\family typewriter
-classpath
\family default
 option, like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Running with the Launcher (on JDK)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the launcher, we can run our application and take a look at the result.
 Using a command shell, execute the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java -classpath .;%CLASSPATH% totalcross.Launcher HelloWorld

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this case, the usage of the option

 path if you're not using the CLASSPATH environment variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This time, we are executing the program 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
, passing the name of our main class as the first argument, and the platforms
 to deploy as the second argument – in this case all platforms.
 (see Chapter 5 for more information about the Deployment process).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new folder named 
\family typewriter
install
\family default
 will be created, and inside it you should find several folders, each one
 containing the installer (or the executable) for each supported platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should be able now to run the Win32 version of our application, so let's
 move to 
\family typewriter
./install/ win32
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default screen size is 240x320.
 You can change the screen size and position by editing the 
\family typewriter
.exe
\family default
 shortcut and adding the parameter 
\family typewriter
/scr x,y,width,height
\family default
.
 The possible values are: -1 to use the default and -2 to center on screen.
 Ex: "
\family typewriter
/scr -2,100,320,-1
\family default
" will open a window horizontally centered at y=100, w=320, h=320 (default
 is 0,0,240,320).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Deployment Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deploy your TotalCross application, you must use the Java application
 named 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
, packaged with the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 located at 
\family typewriter
%TOTALCROSS_HOME%/dist
\family default
.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To run a Java application from a jar file, you must specify the source 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 to the Java classpath, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
java -classpath %TOTALCROSS_HOME%
\backslash
dist
\backslash
tc.jar tc.Deploy […]
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 program will, starting in the working directory, create folders with the
 installation files for each platform.
 A 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file is outputted with all classes and its dependencies, already translated
 to the target opcodes, and compressed with ZLib to save space.
 We recommend that the original classes are compiled with debug information,
 because line numbers will be included in the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 and will be available in the stack trace (all other debug information is
 discarded in the default compilation).
 
\family typewriter
.bmp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.gif
\family default
 files are automatically converted to 24bpp 
\family typewriter
.png
\family default
 files (JPeg are kept in its original format – read more about images below).
 The 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file is not compliant with the 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 format, although ZLib is used, because we need to store more information
 in the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file.
 Note that, since we translate the programs to our opcodes, there's no need
 to run obfuscators in the class file, because obfuscation is already done
 by the converter.
 Actually, 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 files are 1/4 of the original class size, 50% due to our tclass file format
 and 50% more due to the ZLib compression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic format is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
tc.Deploy <application/library to deploy> <target platforms> [other options]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
<application/library to deploy>
\family default
 must be one of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The main class file name (the 
\family typewriter
.class
\family default
, not the 
\family typewriter
.java
\family default
).
 You can pass the full path to the main class file instead of its fully
 qualified name (
\family typewriter
App
\family default
 x 
\family typewriter
my.sample.App
\family default
).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, to deploy 
\family typewriter
my.sample.App
\family default
 at 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

C:/myprogram/classes/my/sample/App.class
\family default
:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
cd C:/myprogram/classes
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

tc.Deploy my/sample/App.class
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
tc.Deploy c:/myprogram/classes/my/sample/App.class
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The correct package is automatically detected from the class file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The folder that contains a single class that implements 
\family typewriter
MainClass
\family default
 or directly extends one of the following classes: 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
TestSuite
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
GameEngineMainWindow
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This option will not work if your main class extends a class which in turn
 extends one of the classes listed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming 
\family typewriter
App
\family default
 is the main class, “
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
App
\family default
” will work, but “
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
AnotherClass
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
App
\family default
” will not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option will also fail if the given folder contains more than one valid
 main class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The deployer automatically detects and includes 
\family typewriter
Class.forName()
\family default
 references.
 Note that the parameter must be a string literal.
 
\family typewriter
Class.forName()
\family default
 will not work yet if the parameter is a variable containing the class name.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 file containing all the required files, like 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy App.jar
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy App.zip
\family default
 (a 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file is basically a 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 file with a new extension).
 To create a 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file, open the command prompt, change to the class files folder (usually
 
\family typewriter
/bin
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
/classes
\family default
), and type: 
\family typewriter
jar cvf App.jar
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Please notice this is the only option that does not require a main class
 to be used, therefore, it's the only valid option to create libraries (which
 usually does not have a main class).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a library, you must end your 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 name with 
\family typewriter
lib
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Lib
\family default
, such as 
\family typewriter
xxxlib.jar
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
xxxLib.jar
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if you use this option to deploy an application, the 
\family typewriter
.jar/.zip
\family default
 file must have the same name of the main class.
 (e.g.
 if your main class is 
\family typewriter
App.class
\family default
, the resulting 
\family typewriter
.jar/.zip
\family default
 file must be either 
\family typewriter
App.jar
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
App.zip
\family default
).

\begin_layout Section
Specifying the Icon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to create an icon is to provide a file whose name ends with
 
\family typewriter
appicon.png
\family default
 of SQUARE size 256x256 and any palette, which will be automatically converted
 to the target icon sizes.
 Put the file in the 
\family typewriter
src
\family default
 folder.
 If your icon source is VECTOR-based, you may create better icons by exporting
 to 
\family typewriter
.png
\family default
 at the following sizes: 
\family typewriter
icon60x60.png
\family default
 (iOS), 
\family typewriter
icon72x72.png
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
icon96x96.png
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
icon144x144.png
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
icon192x192
\family default
 (Android).
 Note that TotalCross' algorithm used to downscale the icons, CATMULL-ROM,
 is the best of the world for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be careful with the palette of the 
\family typewriter
.bmp
\family default
 files, never use the MS Paint program; instead, get the 
\family typewriter
.bmp
\family default
 files that are in the 
\family typewriter
etc/images
\family default
 folder and edit them in a software that keeps the original palette, like
 Photoshop and PaintShopPro.
 Use alpha-channel on PNG for better appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On iOS, if you don't provide all icon sizes for the different iOS devices,
 the deployer will get the icon image with the greatest resolution and scale
 it to match the icon size of the missing necessary sizes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Adding other files to the package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optionally, you can create a 
\family typewriter
.pkg
\family default
 file with additional files that will be added to the 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
,
\family typewriter
 
\family default
to the 
\family typewriter
.ipa
\family default
, etc.
 The file must have a set of 
\family typewriter
[G]
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
[L]
\family default
 lines followed by the file name (which is searched in the classpath and
 in current folder).
 Files prefixed with 
\family typewriter
[G]
\family default
 were placed in the same folder of the TCVM in the past.
 Nowadays, using 
\family typewriter
[G]
\family default
 is the same of using 
\family typewriter
[L]
\family default
, to put the file in the application's folder.
 If the file ends with a slash, indicating that it's a path, all files inside
 that path will be added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The possible 
\family typewriter
.pkg
\family default
 files are: 
\family typewriter
iphone.pkg
\family default
 (also used for iPad and iPod), 
\family typewriter
android.pkg
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
linux.pkg
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
wp8.pkg
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
win32.pkg
\family default
 – for each platform, or 
\family typewriter
all.pkg
\family default
 for all platforms.
 The files must be 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
s.
 All adicional needed files must be listed in the 
\family typewriter
.pkg
\family default
 file and the main program should be deployed as if it used only one file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: suppose program 
\family typewriter
A.jar
\family default
 needs two libraries named 
\family typewriter
BLib.jar
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CLib.jar
\family default
.
 Then you must deploy each one to create a 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 and create a 
\family typewriter
.pkg
\family default
 with the following lines:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

 create a certificate to distribute in-house applications.
 Applications signed with this certificate may be distributed 
\emph on

\family typewriter
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout request.key -out 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If successful, there will be two new files on the folder: 
\family typewriter
request.key
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
request.csr
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now go to the iOS Provisioning Portal and request a new distribution certificate.
 When prompted for a certificate request, use the file 
\family typewriter
request.csr
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Uploading the certificate request may fail on some browsers, but it should
 work on Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.
 Try using a different browser if the certificate request is not accepted.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Download the newly created certificate (which name is by default 
\family typewriter
ios_distribution.cer
\family default
) and run the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
openssl x509 -in ios_distribution.cer -inform DER -out 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ios_distribution.pem -outform PEM

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

-out ios_distribution.p12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When prompted for a password, just hit enter and leave it empty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you must go back to the iOS Provisioning Portal to create a new mobile
 provision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the iOS Provisioning Portal, go to "App IDs" to create an id for your
 application.
 Make sure to double check everything when creating ids because once created
 they cannot be removed! There's no limit to the number of app ids you can
 have, but you don't want to end up with dozens of unused ids cluttering
 your page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this first time, we suggest you to use the wildcard app id that should
 come configured by default (if you don't have it, just create one using
 * as Bundle Identifier).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now move on to Provisioning, switch to the Distribution tab and click on
 "New Profile".
 In "Distribution Method" choose "In House", and use the same distribution
 certificate and app ids you already created.
 Name it and after submitting use the download option in the Distribution
 tab to download it to the same folder where you have your certificate and
 keystore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile provision allows only the application with the specified id to
 run on the device.
 If you create the mobile provision using the wildcard app id, it will allow
 any application signed by you to work on the device, making it very useful
 for testing your applications without creating additional ids that can't
 be removed later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After completing this steps you should have the following files:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally change the key 
\family typewriter
<string>
\family default
 element to your application name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last step and you will be able to install your application over the

 Create a web page 
\family typewriter

\family default
 on the web server that contains an anchor element as follows: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Standard
At this point if you have setup everything correctly you will be able to
 manually update / install your application by pointing the iOS Safari browser
 to 
\family typewriter
test.html
\family default
 on you hosted web server.
 When you click on the link iOS will popup a screen asking if you would
 like to install the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now you can manually update your TotalCross application.
 If you want to be able to do automatic updates via TotalCross all you need
 to do is execute the following once your application detects a new version
 is available
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will launch Safari and execute the same process as doing an update
 manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course your application has to have a mechanism to detect when a new
 version is available and be able to update itself, but that is outside
 the scope of these instructions.

 Using this program one can even copy the device files to the computer.
 Before stalling DiskAid, it is desirable to install iTunes.
 Moreover, some configurations must be done in order to show a TotalCross
 Application.
 Just go to DiskAid-->Preferences and check the options to show all files,
 applications, etc.
 Your application is inside Apps.
 Just double-click it to see the application folders.

Deployment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to deploy your application to Android:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.Deploy .....
 -android (or -all)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A directory named 
\family typewriter
install
\backslash
android
\family default
 will be created with a single 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 inside.
 This 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 contains your application's TCZ and the launcher.
 You can install additional files by creating an 
\family typewriter
android.pkg
\family default
 (or 
\family typewriter
all.pkg
\family default
).
 The deployer will search for a file named 
\family typewriter
icon72x72.png
\family default
 as a special icon for it (remember to use alpha channel in the PNG for
 better appearance); if it doesn't find the file, it will resize the file
 ended with 
\family typewriter
appicon.gif
\family default
 (already used in other platforms) to 72x72 and use it.
 The first time that TotalCross, Litebase, and your application run, it
 will take longer because the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 (and possibly other libraries) will be being decompressed and installed
 in the application's data folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORTANT: On Android you can only read/write from 
\family typewriter
Settings.appPath
\family default
 (which is 
\family typewriter
/data/ data/totalcross.app.<your application name here>
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
/data/data/
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

totalcross.app<application id>
\family default
 if using single package).
 Trying to access a file or a path elsewhere will fail with permission error.
 You can't even list the files from elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installing on the Device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) is the tool that is used to install applicati
ons in the device, and also to get the log from it.
 This tool is released with the TotalCross SDK and is located at 
\family typewriter
%TOTALCROSS_HOME%
\backslash
etc
\backslash
tools
\backslash
android
\family default
.
 If you plan to use it from the command-line, add it to the PATH environment
 variable of your computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be sure that the Android device is connected to USB and that the driver
 was installed.
 To be able to find if the Android device is ok, type (from cmd):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the device is ok, it will be listed (like this):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
HT9A3LV00045 device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number above is the serial number of the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install the file on the device, you can use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb install -r xxx.apk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: if you're running on Windows and installed 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK.exe
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
setup.bat
\family default
 file at the root has created a registry entry that adds an “Install APK”
 file to the right-button click in Windows Explorer.
 This greatly helps installing any application in the device.
 So, just open Windows Explorer, select the APK file, right-click your mouse
 button, and select “Install APK”.
 The file will then be uploaded to the device.
 Note that the registry key adds this menu option to all file types, so,
 be careful to use it only with 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, if you want to test the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossAPI.apk
\family default
, from the command line, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb install -r TotalCrossAPI.apk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember to install the TotalCross and Litebase 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 (if your application is not deployed as a single package) as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb install -r %TOTALCROSS_HOME%
\backslash
dist
\backslash

Note that from Android version 4.3, you can't downgrade a program installed
 on the device.
 Therefore, if your currently installed application version (as in
\family typewriter
 Settings.appVersion
\family default
) is greater than the version of the same application to be replaced, you
 won't be able to reinstall it.
 You must first uninstall the newer program version and them install the
 old program version.

Debugging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug()
\family default
 outputs to a file named

\family default
 at the application's folder.
 You can alternatively set the output to the ADB logger by calling 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug(Vm.ALTERNATIVE_DEBUG)
\family default
.
 Open the command prompt and type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb logcat TotalCross:I *:S

More on ADB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On some devices it is not easy to access the debugging or using other commands
 using ADB.
 Moreover, since an Android device can be built from different enterprises,
 their settings and configuration menu will look differently from each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, the following steps leads you to get USB debugging turned
 on the Galaxy S4, OS 4.3.
 On other Androids, it may be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From within the GS4 you have to enable the "unknown sources" option for
 the installation of applications, though the "allow debug" checkbox doesn't
 seem to be included anymore.
 It should be in Developer Options.
 If your device is running Android 4.2,

: When you connect a device running Android 4.2.2 or higher to your computer,
 the system shows a dialog asking whether to accept an RSA key that allows

 This security mechanism protects user devices because it ensures that USB
 debugging and other adb commands cannot be executed unless you're able
 to unlock the device and acknowledge the dialog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Using the Release Vms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you decide to release the application to your client, you must purchase
 TotalCross+Litebase licenses.
 See the correct approach going to the TotalCross 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "site"
target "http://www.totalcross.com"

\end_inset

 and clicking the buy item at the horizontal menu.
 Once we detect the payment, we will then create an activation key and enable
 it at the site.
 Login in the account and press the “Check activation keys and licenses”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross site has two types of accounts: one for the user that downloads
 the SDK, and one for the user that purchases licenses.
 They can even have the same e-mail, however, the passwords are necessarily
 different.
 The account that is used to download the SDK cannot see the activation
 VMs, however, the account that is used to download the activation VMs can
 see both.
 So, if you login using the SDK user and password, you will NOT be able
 to download the VMs, neither see the “Check activation keys and licenses”
 submenu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have lots of costumers, you can create new activation keys and transfer
 credits between them.
 All this can be done at the site.
 Note that an activation key cannot be deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More information can be found at the TotalCross site, under the Products
 menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Signing your application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you get access to the activation key, you must sign your application
 with it, using the deploy's 
\family typewriter
/r
\family default
 option.
 Just do something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.Deploy … /r <activation key>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Activating your application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you login with the right account, download the TotalCross VMS package.
 This package is complimentary to the TotalCross SDK: it only contains special
 virtual machines that will authenticate to our server (hosted at Rackspace
 – Boston USA) at the first time that the application runs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM uses the port 80 and connects a to webservice located at www.superwaba.net
 server.
 So, if you're behind a firewall or a proxy, remember to allow connections
 to this site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time that the application runs on the device, it generates a file
 named 
\family typewriter
tcreq.pdb
\family default
 at the application's folder, containing the IMEI and the serial number.
 Then it connects to the server and, if succeed, replaces the file with
 a 
\family typewriter
tcsuc.pdb
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the device is hard-reseted (looses everything), a new connection to the
 server will be made once the program runs again.
 However, a new license will NOT be consumed, since the device was already
 activated once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you upgrade the device's firmware, the serial number may change.
 In this case, when a new activation is done, it will consume a new license,
 since the information that is used to track the device was changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The license is per-device.
 If the device is stolen, broken, or the costumer replaces it by another
 one, a new license is consumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a special contract that can be made with us that will allow you
 to replace a device and return the license.
 Contact us at the site if you desire to be covered by this special agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some devices may not have an IMEI nor a serial number accessible by software.
 On these devices, a hard-reset will result in the consumption of one more
 lisence if there is no backup of the activation file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you sign your application with two activation keys, the license will
 be discounted again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

You can instruct the VM to call a custom web service created by yourself.
 This web service will process the login/password to allow or deny the activatio

So, this is a summary of what you have to do in your application:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Specify the address of the web service using 
\family typewriter
Settings.activationServerURI
\family default
 (and optionally also the namespace using

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

activationServerNamespace

 This must be done inside the static initializer of your main class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optionally, if you want to create a custom screen to show at startup, follow
 the instructions described previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that its impossible to run any code from your application before the
 activation.
 The only possible way to show a custom screen is from the 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Your web service must obey the given interface:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
public static String[] activate(String request, String[] keys, String[]
 values) throws Exception
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The request parameter cannot be changed and must be passed to our web service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The keys and values contains some basic information used by the activation,
 such as the device model, the serial number, the IMEI, and also any other
 parameters defined in the 
\family typewriter
.html
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you apply your own logic to confirm if this is a valid user (like
 checking the login and password), you must connect to our web service,
 sending the request string as parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The return of this method must be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If error: an array with a single element with the error message that will
 be displayed to the user (like new 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If success: a two dimensional array, where the first element is a message
 that will be displayed to the user, and the second element is the answer
 received from our server.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Attention: the activation server that this web service uses is our production
 server, so, one credit will be consumed each time that the activation succeeds
 in a computer that was never activated.
 In other words, be aware that your tests will consume a license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use this piece of code to control if a device has already been activated

\begin_layout Chapter
TotalCross 3.0 Differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross 3.0 we dropped support for Windows CE and Windows Mobile platforms,
 since these platforms are discontinued and replaced by Windows Phones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to support these platforms, you must download TotalCross 2.0,
 which still supports these platforms.
 Note that Litebase 2.7 works for TotalCross 1.7 (and up), and TotalCross
 2.0 (and up).
 TotalCross 3.0 (and up) uses Litebase 2.8.
 Litebase differences for TotalCross 3.0 are just some small path changes
 to run on WP8.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we recommend is that you use TotalCross 2.0 only for those two platforms,
 and use TotalCross 3.0 for all other platforms.
 Many SDKs can coexist in the same machine, just rename them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we recommend is that you use TotalCross 1.7 only for those two platforms,
 and use TotalCross 2 for all other platforms.
 Both SDKs can coexist in the same machine, just rename them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Developing for all currently supported platforms: use 
\family typewriter
TotalCross3/dist/tc.jar
\family default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deploying for Android, iOS, Windows 32, Linux, Windows Phone 8, and browser:
 use 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

TotalCross3/dist/tc.jar
\family default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deploying for Windows CE: use 
\family typewriter
TotalCross2/dist/tc.jar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deploying for Palm OS and Blackberry: use 
\family typewriter
TotalCross1.7/dist/tc.jar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The great main improvement in TotalCross 3.0 is the support of the new and
 rapidly growing Windows Phone 8.
 We opt to not give support to Windows Phone 7 since its market share is
 small and Microsoft decided to develop WP8 just some time later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installation Package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it is only needed to download and install one 
\family typewriter
.exe
\family default
 for TotalCross and Litebase SDK and VM.
 Make sure to change the paths used in your deploying process to reflect
 this change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Windows Phone 8, DirectX is used instead of the old scheme of bitmaps.
 In the furure releases, DirectX will also be used for Windows 32 in order
 to improve graphics performance.
 However, older Windows 32 releases won't be supported anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On iOS 7 or above use the field 
\family typewriter
Windows.taskbarColor
\family default
 in order to paint the iOS floating task bar.
 It defaults to the application's background color.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Font
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only change is that now there is no size limit to the font.
 However, fonts whose size is greater than 160 will be blurred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Reflection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the reflection API of Java 1.1 is full implemented.
 To know more about it, please check javadoc or take a look at this link
 explaining it:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://www.tns.lcs.mit.edu/manuals/java-1.1.1/guide/reflection/index.html"
target "http://www.tns.lcs.mit.edu/manuals/java-1.1.1/guide/reflection/index.html"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SQLite and TDBC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now there is another database option in TotalCross.
 SQLite was included in the platorm, so that TotalCross will use the same
 SQLite version for all supported platforms.
 If it used the one available on the device when it has one, there could
 be differences in the API or table format.
 But remember that Litebase eases the task of synchronizing the device tables
 with tables on server databases such as SQLServer or Oracle by using the
 class 
\family typewriter
RowIterator
\family default
.
 If you want to do something similar using SQLite, you will have to do it
 from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The currently SQLite version used is 3.8.
 If you intend to use it, please take a look at its documentation at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://www.sqlite.org/"
target "http://www.sqlite.org/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The access to SQLite is through TDBC, a JDBC driver for TotalCross.
 The TDBC implementation was based on JDBC 2.1.
 We did not implement everything.
 Below is a list of JDBC classes and interfaces that were and were not implement
ed:

.
 You can check TDBC javadoc in the package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.db.sqlite
\family default
.
 In the future, other databases might be added to TotalCross using JDBC
 specification.
 It is also intended to provide Litebase access using the JDBC API.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
TotalCross 2 Differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross 2 we dropped support for Palm OS and BlackBerry platforms,
 since these platforms are discontinued or replaced in the market by Android
 and iOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to support these platforms, you must download TotalCross 1.7,
 which still supports these platforms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we recommend is that you use TotalCross 1.7 only for these two platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applications created with TotalCross 2 can be hosted at Apple's Appstore,
 using the developer distibution certificate, so we dropped support for
 Cydia in TotalCross 2.
 Due to this, all iOS samples are not included in the SDK, because to install
 them you need a certificate.
 We intend to put some samples at Apple´s Appstore.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross 2 was created to improve graphics perfomance.
 We made a full rewrite of the native Graphics API to use Open GL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross 1, the screen is drawn in a native bitmap, and then the bitmap
 is drawn on the screen using the device's graphics API.
 Everything, like lines, filled rectangles, and images are rendered by software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross 2, we use Open GL, where everything is rendered by the hardware
 graphics processor.
 So, when you load an image, it is moved inside the video memory, and then
 all draws of the image are instantaneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open GL is used on Android and iOS.
 For Java SE and Windows 32, it uses the old scheme of bitmaps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the speed performance that Open GL provides, there are some drawbacks.
 The main one is that Open GL requires that the whole screen is painted
 on each screen update.
 For example, in TotalCross 1, when an Edit's cursor is blinking, only the
 cursor is painted at each screen update, while in TotalCross 2, the whole
 screen is painted each time the cursor blinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another consequence of this requirement is that you cannot update the screen
 in a thread.
 So, in TotalCross 1, the spinner class was able to draw only the spinner
 in a thread; this is impossible in TotalCross 2, which makes the spinner
 useless under some circunstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An advantage of Open GL is that it supports alpha channel by hardware.
 Due to this, we removed support for the 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
's transparent color.
 So, all 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 methods that would receive a transparent color were deprecated (like rotate,
 scale, etc), and you must use images with alpha-channel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Open GL, the 
\family typewriter
getPixels()
\family default
 operation is veeeeryyyy sloooowwww, and can cut all the performance gain
 that you have with Open GL, so we removed support and deprecated for all
 graphics methods that requires the read of the screen pixels (the methods
 are still there but their effects are ignored):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Graphics.useAA
\family default
 (for smooth antialiased lines) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Graphics.drawDottedCursor()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
We also deprecated these: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Image.NO_TRANSPARENT_COLOR
\family default
 (removed) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Image.useAlpha

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Window.highResPrepared
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Settings.useNewFont
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And added: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Image.applyChanges()
\family default
: in TotalCross 2, moves the image inside the video memory; in TotalCross
 1, does nothing.
 Note that you do not have to call this method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Font
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original font of TotalCross was a Tahoma font generated inside a Windows
 CE device.
 When we moved it to Open GL, the results were very poor, so we decided
 to change the font to the Android's default font and created the font inside
 an Android 4.1 device.
 This font is used in both TotalCross 1.7 and 2.0.
 We also changed the minimum size to 7 and the maximum size to 48.
 This new font is a bit narrower than the previous one, so it may not cause
 impacts in the user interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Litebase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please notice that all indices files must be erased in order to use Litebase
 tables created with version 2.67 with Litebase 2.7 and vice-versa.
 Moreover, tables using cryptography created in version 2.7 can't be used
 with version 2.67.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Litebase to SQLite Conversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since TotalCross now supports SQLite using TDBC, some programmers might
 want to migrate a program that uses Litebase to use SQLite.
 Here is a guide to help the conversion process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The supported SQL commands are described in the link 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://sqlite.org/lang.html"
target "http://sqlite.org/lang.html"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
totalcross.db.sqlite.ui.DBListBox
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
litebase.ui.DBListBox
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The class 
\family typewriter
totalcross.db.sqlite.SQLiteUtil
\family default
 methods will make the process much easier.
 Take a look at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no way to go back when navigating in a 
\family typewriter
ResultSet
\family default
 using something such as 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.prev()
\family default
.
 You can only navigate forward (using 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.next()
\family default
), never backward.
 There are also no 
\family typewriter
first()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
last()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
beforeFirst()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
afterLast()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

absolute()
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
relative()
\family default
.
 All result set pointers are before the first result set record when created.
 If it is necessary to go backwards in a result set, you must close and
 recreate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When fetching a DATETIME field with 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getString()
\family default
, notice that Litebase will return the field in the format 
\family typewriter
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
\family default
 whereas SQLite returns in the format 
\family typewriter
YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The class which deals with connections is called 
\family typewriter
Connection
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no multiple languages in SQLite messages.
 All messages from database exceptions are only in English.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
litebase.DriverException
\family default
 must be changed to 
\family typewriter
java.sql.SQLException
\family default
.
 It won't work if you use 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sql.SQLException
\family default
!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.getInstance(XXXX)
\family default
 must be changed to 
\family typewriter
DriverManager.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:XXXX
\backslash

\backslash
YYYY.db")
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
XXXX
\family default
 is the desired path and 
\family typewriter
YYYY
\family default
 is the database name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.closeAll()
\family default
 must be changed to 
\family typewriter
Connection.close()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.execute
\family default
/
\family typewriter
executeUpdate()
\family default
 must be changed to 
\family typewriter
Connection.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

createStatement().execute
\family default
/
\family typewriter
executeUpdate()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All methods throws 
\family typewriter
SQLException
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In Litebase, in order to not create a table if it exists, you should do
 something such as
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (!conn.exists("table_name"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   conn.execute("create table table_name...");
\end_layout

\end_inset

In SQLite, there is a single command that does it: 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

create table if not exists table_name
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is also a command to only drop a table if it exists: 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

drop table if exists table_name
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
SQLiteUtil.getColCount()
\family default
 to get the number of columns of a 
\family typewriter
ResultSet
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no way to get the total number of rows of a 
\family typewriter
ResultSet
\family default
 using SQLite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
SQLiteUtil.tableExists()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.exists()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getMetaData()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getResultSetMetaData()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All data returned in the SQLite metadata methods are in uppercase, whereas
 in Litebase they are always in lowercase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no cryptography in the free SQLite version, the one included in
 TotalCross.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change 
\family typewriter
nocase
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
collate nocase
\family default
 in order to make a field case insensitive.
 You can also use 
\family typewriter
collate nocase
\family default
 to make a comparison case insensitive.
 However, the first option is preferable if the column will always be used
 in a case insensitive way because it is faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
ResultSetMetaData.XXXX_TYPE
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
Types.XXXX
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getBlob()
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getBytes()
\family default
 when dealing with a blob column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
ResultSet.getStrings()
\family default
 to one of the methods 
\family typewriter
SQLUtil.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

getStrings()
\family default
 to fetch all rows from the current result set pointer.
 To fetch only some rows, you must implement it yourself, or use the keywords
 
\family typewriter
LIMIT
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
OFFSET
\family default
 in your SQLite select statement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.listAllTables()
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
SQLUtil.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ListAllTables()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To create a memory database, use 
\family typewriter
DriverManager.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

getConnection("jdbc:sqlite::memory:")
\family default
.
 By default, the database is created in the application folder (
\family typewriter
/device
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.getRowCount()
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
SQLiteUtil.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

getRowCount()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is nothing similar to 
\family typewriter
RowIterator
\family default
.
 You must simulate the updates in the table manually, creating new columns
 or moving data to another table and then select it.
 Just remember that the space used by a deleted row might be reused if SQLite
 needs it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change from 
\family typewriter
LitebaseConnection.purge()
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
Connection.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

execute("vacuum;")
\family default
.
 In SQLite you do a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

purge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in all tables in the database, not in a specific table such as in Litebase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In SQLite the 
\family typewriter
PreparedStatement
\family default
 index begin with 1, not 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no size definition when creating a blob column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
Time.getSQLString()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Date.getSQLString()
\family default
 to format time and date in the SQL format, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no type checking in SQLite.
 You can put whatever you want in any column.
 If you don't want to insert data in a column with wrong data type, your
 program must ensure that it behaves as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All string data inserted is stored in unicode.
 It's not possible to create an ascii database in order to save space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is not possible to erase all indices in a single SQL statement such as
 the one used in Litebase: 
\family typewriter
drop index * on table_name
\family default
.
 Moreover, to drop a specific index, you must drop it using its name, using
 
\family typewriter
drop index IDX_NAME
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter
drop index on 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

table_name(column_name)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can't alter a table to add or drop a primary key in SQLite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Important rules about date and time in SQLite:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
DATE
\family default
 type: must be in the form: 
\family typewriter
YYYY-MM-DD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
TIME
\family default
 type: must be in the form: 
\family typewriter
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MMM
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When using 
\family typewriter
BETWEEN
\family default
 or any other date/time comparation, the arguments MUST MATCH the type form.
 So, in 
\family typewriter
select borndate from test where borndate between 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

'2014-12-10' and '2014-12-14'
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\family typewriter
borndate
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
DATE
\family default
, the comparison will succeed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\family typewriter
borndate
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
TIME
\family default
, the comparison will fail.
 To make it work, use 
\family typewriter
select borndate from test where borndate between '2014-12-10 00:00:00.000'
 and 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

'2014-12-14 00:00:00.000'
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
SuperWaba to TotalCross Conversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the conversion easier, we created a program, 
\family typewriter
tc.tools.SW2TC
\family default
 (included in 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
), which recursively reads a set of folders and change the names of the
 old SuperWaba packages, classes and methods to the new ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program does not create a backup, it simply overwrites the original
 files, so you should backup your files before running the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This converter takes care of about 99% of the problems, remaining only 1%
 for you to manually update.
 Also, the program is just a token replacer, therefore, it cannot find that
 in "xxx.yyy", xxx is a ListBox nor a hotdog, so it cannot replace tokens
 based on the type.
 Always refer to this table 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br/pt/sw2tc.asp"

\end_inset

), where we summarize the package, class, and method changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
General Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some important tips to finish the conversion after running the SW2TC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SW2TC cannot change some method names, refer to the javadocs for the new
 name of these methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The return type of some methods were changed, most of them used to return
 a 
\family typewriter
boolean
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 value to indicate success or failure and now return 
\family typewriter
void
\family default
.
 Errors handling is done with exceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many methods now throw checked exceptions, which must be handled accordingly.
 In SuperWaba, there were almost no validation on the arguments passed to
 the methods; in TotalCross, nearly all methods perform argument validation,
 throwing the appropriate exception for each case (in the future, this will
 be extended to all arguments and methods).
 To easily display the exception to the user, you can use the static method
 
\family typewriter
MessageBox.showException
\family default
.
 Read the tip described in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ALWAYS handle the exceptions thrown.
 Ignoring exceptions or simply logging the error without handling the exception
 is just wrong.
 Also remember that unchecked exceptions are usually caused by bad programming
 and are not supposed to be caught, unless you're using an unchecked exception
 instead of testing a condition.

The method 
\family typewriter
isOpen()
\family default
 was removed from all streams.
 Their constructors now throw an

IOException
\family default
 (or a subclass of it, like 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
) if the operation fails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In SuperWaba some classes had a 
\family typewriter
lastError
\family default
 field that had a platform dependent error code; in TotalCross this field
 no longer exists, the exception message contains a platform dependent error
 message identifying the error.
 This error message is provided by the underlying OS and may not be as helpful
 as expected, but it's still better than an error value.
 If the OS is unable to find a given error code on its error table, the
 exception message will have only the error code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter
onStart()
\family default

\family default
 were respectively renamed to

\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

onAddAgain()
\family default
.
 The SW2TC should perform these changes, but if the screen appears blank
 for some reason, check if the method 
\family typewriter
onStart()
\family default
 was not renamed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_MOVED
\family default

 It was usually used to update the

 Now the correct approach is to do a 
\family typewriter
getGraphics()
\family default
 in all places 
\family typewriter
myg
\family default
 was used.

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Settings.onDevice
\family default
 is now called 
\family typewriter
onJavaSE
\family default
 (Standard Edition), but notice it has the opposite meaning! Be sure to
 search for this field and make sure it is being used correctly.
 For instance:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
if (Settings.onDevice)
\family default
 replaced 
\family typewriter
for if(!Settings.onJavaSE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All classes that extend 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 must explicitly set 
\family typewriter
focusTraversable = true
\family default
 in the constructor, otherwise the class will not be able to receive focus
 using the keyboard in penless devices.
 This flag defaults to true in SuperWaba, but to false in TotalCross.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Correct way to handle Exceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decided to write this to explain to programmers how to deal with exceptions.
 It does not apply only to TotalCross, but also to all other languages that
 make use of exceptions.
 One of the main differences between SuperWaba and TotalCross is the dispatch
 of exceptions by the API.
 Careless programmers tend to code this way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f = new File(...);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e){}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, just ignore the exception that is being thrown.
 A programmer that codes this way should be fired for carelessness.
 A variation of this approach is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	Vm.debug("An exception was thrown");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the programmer informs itself that the exception was thrown but completely
 ignores crucial information that can help to resolve the problem.
 And he will see the exception only if he opens the 
\family typewriter
DebugConsole.txt
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second error is to handle exceptions in the same method it was thrown,
 like in this sample:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createReport()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		createFile();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		runReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createFile()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		f = new File("report.txt", File.CREATE_EMPTY);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		e.printStackTrace();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the problem here? Simple: the 
\family typewriter
createReport()
\family default
 method is unable to confirm that the file was created or failed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what's the correct way? The correct implementation is always throw the
 exception to the caller, and this to its caller, and so on, until you reach
 a root method that cannot pass the exception along, like the 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 methods (since these methods are overriden and you cannot change the method's
 signature).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the correct implementation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createReport() throws IOException
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		createFile();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		runReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createFile() throws IOException
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		f = new File("report.txt", File.CREATE_EMPTY);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing this way, in the root method, we would do:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	createReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	MessageBox.showException(e,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this approach is not yet perfect, because the 
\family typewriter
createFile()
\family default
 method is throwing 
\family typewriter
Exception
\family default
, while 
\family typewriter
new File()
\family default
 throws three exceptions: 
\family typewriter
IllegalArgumentIOException
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
.
 Hence, the correct is that each exception be declared on its own in the
 throws clause of the method, and that your program handle them in the correct
 way.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
IllegalArgumentIOException
\family default
 occurs most times by a coding error and should never occur in production
 code.
 However, there may exist some exceptions that are less serious than others
 and can be ignored or handled locally, letting others to be passed along
 to the caller.
 Under situations that the handling is the same for all exceptions, there
 is no problem in catching them in a single 
\family typewriter
catch (Exception e)
\family default
 block.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, what's the correct way to handle the exception? The most common
 is call
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
.
 This is a classic and BAD coding, because the stack trace is logged in
 the debug console (the same output of 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug()
\family default
), and thus the programmer will NOT know that the exception was thrown unless
 he exits the program and looks at the output file (note that in Eclipse
 or any other IDE the 
\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
 shows up in the console panel, not in the file).
 The ideal is that the exceptions are informed in real time, even if this
 can cause some bad impressions in your costumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has a method in the 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 class that shows the exception in a dialog.
 Its format is shown in the previous example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	MessageBox.showException(e,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first parameter is the exception itself, and the second parameter indicates
 if
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
 should be called.
 This method shows the stack trace on screen, along with the exception's
 class name and a description message, if any.
 You can change the title through the 
\family typewriter
MessageBox.showExceptionTitle
\family default
 member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of exceptions is one of the most powerful features of Java, and
 can greatly simplify finding errors, if it is used correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has checked and unchecked exceptions.
 The checked exceptions are 
\family typewriter
Exception
\family default
 subclasses and if they might happen in a code block, it must be surrounded
 by a try-catch.
 The unchecked exceptions are 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
 subclasses and do not need to be treated.
 The first kind of exceptions are usually errors that occur in a program,
 whereas the second one are usually a programming bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 exceptions) and their description:

USER INTERFACE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following chapters will introduce you to the main aspects of user interface
 in TotalCross, including graphical interface controls and events support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
User Interface styles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
List of types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has five look-and-feel types of user interfaces:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Flat
\family default
 – Defines a FLAT user interface style that looks like the Pocket PC look-and-fe
el.
 It's basically the old 
\family typewriter
WinCE
\family default
 style with flat controls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Vista
\family default
 – Defines a Windows Vista user interface style.
 It's like the Flat style with a shaded background.
 It looks better on 16bpp+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Android
\family default
 – Defines an Android user interface style.
 Its like the Vista but with round borders.
 Its almost identical to the controls used by the Android platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style can be switched to by using 
\family typewriter
MainWindow.setUIStyle(int type)
\family default
, and it is platform-idenpendent (can be used in any device of any platform).
 Here is an example of use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public class Foo extends MainWindow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	public Foo()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		super("Hi bar", TAB_ONLY_BORDER);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		setUIStyle(Settings.Android);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision of which user interface to use must be made in the main window's
 constructor.
 If nothing is changed, Vista with a blue background is used.
 Changing the user interface outside the main window's constructor can crash
 your application.
 If you try to change it more than once, a 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
 will be thrown.
 The other possible values to 
\family typewriter
type
\family default
 are: 
\family typewriter
Settings.Flat
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
Settings.Vista
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the pictures below you can see snapshots of the of the old UIGadgets
 sample running on JDK using different resolutions and user interface styles.
 After each picture you'll find the command line options provided to the
 launcher on each case:

\begin_layout Section
Support for devices without pen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iOS and Android platforms introduced the use of finger instead of pen
 (however, some new Android works better with pens than with finger, such
 as some devices with barcode scanner).
 A finger is much less precise than a pen, thus an algorithm is used to
 locate the closest control.
 These platforms also introduced the concept of drag and flick: drag means
 that you placed your finger in the screen and moved it while pressed, and
 flick means that you suddenly lifted the finger, to continue the scroll
 even while your finger is up.
 The scroll then slows down until a complete stop or if you press the finger
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross 1.3 added support for this, activated when you set the user interface
 style to Android or when making 
\family typewriter
Settings.fingerTouch = true
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following controls supports flicking: button menu, grid, list box, list
 container, multi edit, scroll container (and its subtypes), tabbed container,
 and tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\family typewriter
fingerTouch
\family default
 is true, controls that can be flicked replace the scroll bar by a scroll
 position control, which only appears while the control is being scrolled
 or flicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Font Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To keep the user interface consistent across different platforms, TotalCross
 applications uses its own font types instead of using the device's font
 type.
 The basic font type chosen for TotalCross is the Tahoma font, included
 on the SDK as the 
\family typewriter
TCFont.tcz file
\family default
.
 It contains fonts with no size limit, regular and bold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

height_special "totalheight"
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unicode fonts are not included in the default font file!
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base size of the application's font is defined as 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE
\family default
, which is a constant initialized at runtime based on the screen resolution.
 This way you may select another size by using a relative value, like 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE+2
\family default
 (which is equal to 
\family typewriter
Font.BIG_SIZE
\family default
), and the font will be correctly scaled among different resolutions.
 The constants 
\family typewriter
Font.MIN_FONT_SIZE
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Font.MAX_FONT_SIZE
\family default
 have the minimum and maximum font size, respectively.
 Their default values are 7 and 80 (48 for Windows 32), respectively, but
 can be changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, 
\family typewriter
Font.TABSIZE
\family default
 is the number of spaces that will drawn when a tab character is found by
 the VM.
 You can define the number of spaces that will be drawn setting this field.
 It defaults to 3, but you can change it at any time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create your own font files you may use the 
\family typewriter
FontGenerator
\family default
 (included in the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
).
 It creates a compressed file with your own set of bitmap fonts, and supports
 anti-aliased fonts, which makes the font appear rounded and improves legibility.
 The created font must be based on the TrueType fonts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some usage examples (here we assume the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 is in the classpath):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.tools.FontGenerator Arial /aa
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font, but including only the sizes 12 and 14.
 Reducing the final font file from 158kb to 16kb:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.tools.FontGenerator Arial /sizes:12,14 /aa /rename:TCFont
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font with Unicode characters up to 1279, but including
 only sizes 20, 24 and 28, and excluding bold fonts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.tools.FontGenerator Arial /aa /sizes:20,24,28 /nobold
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

/rename:TCFont /u 32-255 256-383 402-402 1024-1279
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
To see if the font you created is installed on the target device, query
 its name after the creation.
 If the font is not found, its name is changed to match the default font.
 When the parameter 
\family typewriter
/rename:
\family default
 is used with 
\family typewriter
TCFont
\family default
, the default font is changed to the new created font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default font name used is stored in 
\family typewriter
Font.DEFAULT
\family default
.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM first calls the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 default constructor (in this case, 
\family typewriter
Foo()
\family default
) and after that it enqueues a timer event, which will then call the 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 method (inherited from the class 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
).
 You 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 initialize all the user interface in the 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 method.
 Initializing the user interface on the constructor might crash the application,
 and some operations can only be performed after the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 method is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
onExit()
\family default
 method is called when the VM exits under normal circumstances , i.e., if
 the user closes the application or the programmer ends the application
 by using 
\family typewriter
exit()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
exec()
\family default
, or even when the application is halted by an unhandled exception.
 However, under abnormal circumstances where a fatal error occurs, reseting
 the device, the 
\family typewriter
onExit()
\family default
 method is not called.
 When this is called, all threads are already killed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the font used by all controls created, you must call the method
 
\family typewriter
setDefaultFont()
\family default
 on the 
\emph on
first line
\emph default
 of the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
's constructor.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you're going to set the

MainWindow
\family default
's title and/or style, you should use 
\family typewriter
super(title, style)
\family default
 instead of the methods 
\family typewriter
setTitle()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
setBorderStyle()
\family default
 to improve performance.
 However, you can't use 
\family typewriter
super()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
setDefaultFont()
\family default
 together because both must be the on first line of the constructor.
 That means you'll have to use 
\family typewriter
setTitle()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
setBorderStyle()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
super(title, style)
\family default
 to be able to use

\begin_layout Section
The Application lifecycle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application on TotalCross has a predefined life cycle, handled by methods
 defined in 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
: called when the application starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onMinimize()
\family default
: called when the user press the home key, or when a call is received, or
 when the screen turns off.
 On Android and Windows 32, the application execution is not paused.
 On Windows Phone 8 and iOS, it is paused.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onResume()
\family default
: called after the call ends, the screen is turned on again, or the program
 was exited softly on Android.
 It is also called again if the user clicks on the application icon on Android
 and iOS.
 On WP8, it is necessary to press back in the main menu and click on the
 opened application.
 Clicking on its icon in the list of applications will kill the current
 instance and relaunches it again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onExit()
\family default
: called when the system decides that is time to finish the application.
 If the home key was pressed, this method is called when another TotalCross
 application is launched on Android if the application is not installed
 as a single package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the user press the home key and then forces the application to stop (by
 going to the Settings / Applications) on Android and iOS, then all Litebase
 tables may be corrupted (actually, no data is lost, but a 
\family typewriter
TableNotClosedException
\family default
 will be issued).
 So, it's a good thing to call 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

LitebaseConnection.closeAll()
\family default
 in your Litebase instances in the 
\family typewriter
onMinimize()
\family default
 method and recover them in the 
\family typewriter
onResume()
\family default
 method.
 Just remember that all prepared statements, row iterators and result sets
 will be invalid and can't be reused.
 Notice that the application might also be killed by the system if it's
 on background.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On WP8, there is no way to kill an application.
 To kill it, you must restore it pressing back in the main menu and them
 openning the application again.
 Then, press back until finishing the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also a good practice to save all necessary data and application state
 so that the when the user goes back to the application it won't need to
 do a task again, such as entering data again in a form which was lost when
 the application was closed by the system.
 Of course there are situations where the user must retype data, such as
 login and password and when using bank applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember that applications for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8 shouldn't
 have an exit button or an exit option in the menu.
 The application should be designed to be opened all the time and only the
 system should close it when needed.
 Again, there are exceptions, for example when the user doesn't agree with
 an eula and the application can't continue running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is a good idea to map the device back key on Android and WP8
 to go back to the last window/menu used.
 Just remember that on WP8 back is back, you just can use it to go back
 to the last screen used.
 On the first screen, back should exit the application.
 The only exception are games, where back during a game play goes to the
 pause window.

\begin_layout Chapter
Adding Controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
 is the base class of all user interface controls, like buttons and labels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Controls must be added to a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 or one of its subclasses, like 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
.
 This container is referred as the parent of the control.
 To set the control bounds in the container, you can use the method 
\family typewriter
setRect(x,y,width,height)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Relative positioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross lets you place controls in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hard and 
\emph on
wrong
\emph default
 way, by setting the control bounds with numbers.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

E.g.: 
\family typewriter
control.setRect(10,10,80,12);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smart way, by using constants for relative coordinates.
 The idea of the relative positioning is to let the programmer concentrate
 mainly on the position and let the sizes be computed automatically.
 The constants are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Coordinate X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Frameless
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1

height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"

LEFT
\family default

, aligns the control at the left of the window’s client rect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring CENTER.OF00

\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
 aligns the control at the right.
 If the parent is a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, aligns the control at the right of the window’s client rect (relative
 to the screen).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

\begin_layout Section
Making UI adjustments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constants described above have one important feature: a variable or
 a number can be used to increment/decrement the result value.
 Examples: 
\family typewriter
CENTER+2
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
BOTTOM-5
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+4
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FILL+2
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
BEFORE-5
\family default
.
 This value cannot be higher than 5, otherwise your interface will not be
 properly shown in other resolutions.
 Using something like 
\family typewriter
LEFT+10
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BOTTOM-15
\family default
 is as bad as using absolute values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, these values suffer a problem: a pixel's size may vary depending
 on the screen's density (also known as DPI).
 So, 4 may be good at a 240x320 screen, but too small in a 600x1024 tablet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To bypass these limitations, we introduced a way to compute that adjustment
 based on the current's font size instead of a fixed pixel value.
 To enable it, you must set the following property at the application's
 static initializer:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
Settings.uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeight = true;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After doing this, the adjustment you make will be a percentage of the font's
 height.
 So, 
\family typewriter
AFTER+50
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
AFTER+
\family default
(50% of font's height), 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+20
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+(
\family default
20% of font's height), and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this feature is not supported by all controls.
 To disable this feature for a particular control the property 
\family typewriter
uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeightIsSupported
\family default
 is set to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 in the class constructor.
\end_layout

The controls can be traversed using the 5-way navigation present on most

 It is automatically activated on penless devices, but can be activated
 on pen devices by setting the property 
\family typewriter
Settings.keyboardFocusTraversable
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
 Controls are traversed according to the order of elements in the field
 
\family typewriter
Container.tabOrder
\family default
.
 The controls are added to the vector in the order as they are added to
 the container.
 This may not be optimal; you may assign a new order by adding the controls
 to the vector:
\end_layout

The last four methods are useful when you’re adding controls that do not
 need to have any of its characteristics (like font or border) changed.
 Changing the control's characteristics 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 those methods will give you unpredictable results.
 This happens because the control does not reposition/resize itself when
 you change its characteristics (just as an example, suppose that the default
 font has 11 in height, and you add the control; then you change the font
 to one with height 22; the control will not be resized and you'll see only
 half of the text).

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getParentWindow()
\family default
 Returns the parent window of this control.
 This is needed because the control’s parent may be a container, whose parent
 may be another container, and so on.
 It returns 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 if there's no parent (e.
 g.: control still not added to any container).
 If this control is a window, will return itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
 Marks the control for repaint.
 When you call 
\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
, the absolute area of the control regarding its parent window is invalidated
 (marked for repaint); then, the next time an event (a keypress, a timer,
 a pen event) occurs, the screen is updated.
 If you call 
\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
 and the control isn't effectively repainted, you can use the 
\family typewriter
repaintNow()
\family default
 method.

If you want to avoid a method call, you can do 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
repaintNow()
\family default
 Redraws the control immediately.
 If this control is a window, the whole window area is marked for repaint

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 The clear method in this class is a placeholder for the other controls.
 It implements an easy way to clear all the controls in the screen.
 When you call the clear method of a container or a window, it recursively
 calls the clear method of all child controls.
 Each control will use 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
clearValueStr()
\family default
 (both defined in this class) as the clear value, depending on the characteristi
cs of the control.
 For example, a 
\family typewriter
ListBox
\family default
 will use the 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt()
\family default
 to set it as the selected index, while an 
\family typewriter
Edit
\family default
 will use the 
\family typewriter
clearValueStr()
\family default
 as the text inside.
 If you want to change the clear value, just assign a new value to one of
 these two fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
reposition()
\family default
 Repositions the control after something has been changed.
 This method is called by the VM to reposition all controls on screen when
 a rotation occurs.
 It calls again 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 with the original parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
onPaint(Graphics
\begin_inset space ~

g)
\family default
 This is the method called when the control is going to be painted.
 You can use the given 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object to draw what you need on screen.
 The default's control font is already set, and the clipping is also set
 to the control's bounds.
 When this method is called, the 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object passed has been translated into the coordinate system of the control
 and the area behind the control has already been painted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
onBoundsChanged()
\family default
 Called after the user invoked the 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 method.
 Good to compute positions that are dependant on the bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
onWindowPaintFinished()
\family default
 Every time 
\family typewriter
_doPaint()
\family default
 finishes paintings all controls, this method is called.
 You can then do actions needed after the screen has finished the paint.
 Note that this method is only called on controls that extends window and
 on the focused control.

Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events represent all activity that goes on between the user and the application.
 When the user interacts with a program, the VM creates an event representing
 the action and communicates these actions to the programs using events.
\end_layout

 make sure you understand both event-handling models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Control Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic types of events: pen events and key events.
 These events are handled by the window, which creates a new event of the
 proper type (pen event or key event) and forwards it to the target control.
 These events are handled by the control, which may convert them to other
 events, defined on the class 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below we can see how each event defined on 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross implements two event-handling models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Inheritance Event Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the Java 1.0 event model, this approach requires you to subclass
 UI components and override the event handling method – 
\family typewriter
onEvent(Event e)
\family default
 – in order to catch and process UI events.
 When a control posts an event (using the 
\family typewriter
postEvent()
\family default
 method) it is propagated sequentially up the UI hierarchy until it is either
 consumed, or the root of the hierarchy is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we have a button inside a tab panel in a window, and this button receives
 an event, the event is propagated up the hierarchy:
\end_layout

After handling the event, you can break the event propagation by setting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a simple example:

status open

\begin_layout Itemize
Disabled controls can only post 
\family typewriter
TIMER
\family default
 events.
 The method 
\family typewriter
postEvent()
\family default
 returns immediately if the control is not enabled and the type of the event
 received is not 
\family typewriter
TIMER
\family default
.
 The only exception to this occurs on fingertouch devices, to allow the
 flick stop or start when a 
\family typewriter
PEN_DOWN
\family default
 occurs in a disabled control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The event propagation stops if the control is moved to another container.
 For example, when you pop up the keyboard, the target edit is removed from
 its parent and added to the keyboard window; at this time, the event propagatio
n (of the key event) stops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 does not receive an event posted by a control in a popup window.
 The only exception for this is the 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
, which is posted to the window that popped it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A control that is not added to a container (or any parent of its container
 is not added to a window) will never receive events nor be repainted.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small programs can handle the events by implementing the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method in the
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MainWindow
\family default
 class, but it can become confusing if the program gets bigger.
 An alternative is to create classes that extend 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 and swap them on the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 as the user navigates through the program.
 Each class implementing the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method will have to handle its own events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Delegation Event Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the event model introduced by Java 1.1, but this approach solves
 some limitations of the Inheritance Event Model, which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To be able to handle events, a class must subclass 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
 and implement the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since all event types are filtered through the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method, the method is executed whenever the control receives an event,
 regardless of its type.
 If a particular event type is ignored by the whole program, it will never
 be handled and consumed.
 Instead, it will keep going up on the hierarchy until it reaches the root,
 wasting resources in the process.
 The only way to avoid it – handling all event types, consuming events that
 are no handled anywhere on the program as soon as they are received – is
 discouraged and can lead to complex and error-prone code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Events are supposed to be handled only by the control that receives the
 event.
 Handling events received by a control in another class is a hard task.
 An example is the tooltip control, which works by handling the pen events
 received by the control it refers to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, an event is propagated from a “source” object to a “listener”
 object by invoking a method on the listener.
 and passing in the instance of the event subclass, which defines the event
 type generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A listener is an object that implements a specific 
\family typewriter
EventListener
\family default
 interface.
 An 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

EventListener
\family default
 interface defines one or more methods which are to be invoked by the event
 source in response to each specific event type handled by the interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An event source is an object which originates events.
 The source defines the set of events it emits by providing a set of 
\family typewriter
add<EventType>Listener(<EventType>Listener)
\family default
 methods which are used to register specific listeners for those events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the same example, using an 
\family typewriter
EventListener()
\family default
 instead of overriding 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
:

Creating listeners using the new

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family default
 This is the event number, used to detect which event was posted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Object
\begin_inset space ~

 This one informs who is receiving the event (e.

PenEvent.PEN_DOWN
\family default
 to a control) or who is posting it (e.
 g.: the control posts an 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline

 For user-interface events, this is the control the event is associated
 with.

Be careful with the timestamp.
 There is no way to convert it to the current

KeyEvent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
KeyEvent
\family default
 is a key press event.
 The 
\family typewriter
key
\family default
 field is the key pressed or entered by other means (grafitti input).
 This is either a normal character key (if the value is < 70000, values
 from the ASCII table) or one of the special keys defined in the 
\family typewriter
DeviceKeys
\family default
 interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the keys defined in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys
\family default
 need a special code to be manipulated: they are not handled by the application
 unless the application requests it.
 For example, the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys.UP
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys.DOWN
\family default
 are automatically sent to the application's event queue, but the 
\family typewriter
SpecialKeys.KEYBOARD_*
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
SpecialKeys.HARD*
\family default
, not.
 To be able to intercept these keys, you must use the method 
\family typewriter
Vm.
 interceptSpecialKeys(mask)
\family default
.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The 
\family typewriter
SpecialKeys
\family default
 interface does not have all possible keys mapped.
 If you have a particular device, you can learn the code of a key by creating
 a test application and calling 
\family typewriter
Vm.showKeyCodes(boolean on)
\family default
.
 When this mode is on, each time a key is pressed, the VM shows an alert
 with the code.
 Then use this key code in the 
\family typewriter
Vm.interceptSpecialKeys()
\family default
.

Some characteristics of TotalCross buttons are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It supports multi-lined text, mixed with images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has five border styles:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
BORDER_NONE
\family default
\series default
 Specifies no border for this button.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium

\family default
 
\series default
Specifies a single-lined border for this button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
BORDER_3D
\family default
\series default
 Specifies a 3d border for this button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
BORDER_3D_GRADIENT_VERTICAL_GRADIENT
\family default
\series default
 Specifies a vertical 3d-gradient border for this button.
 Note that, in this mode, the back and fore colors are set using the
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

borderColor3DG
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
topColor3DG
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
bottomColor3DG
\family default
 properties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
BORDER_3D_GRADIENT_HORIZONTAL_GRADIENT
\family default
 
\series default
Specifies a horizontal 3d-gradient border for this button.
 Note that, in this mode, the back and fore colors are set using the 
\family typewriter
borderColor3DG
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
topColor3DG
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter

\family default
 properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
BORDER_GRAY_IMAGE
\family default
 Specifies that the image passed in the constructor is a gray image that
 will be recolorized and resized to the text's size.
 To create the image that will work with this border type, do this:
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Get an empty image from somewhere in the web (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.aaa-buttons.com/"

\end_inset

 is a good place; choose a light background image to prevent problems described
 in step 5).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do not resize the button.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convert the button to grayscale (you can download IrfanView (
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://www.irfanview.com/"
target "http://www.irfanview.com/"

\end_inset

) and choose menu Image / Convert to Grayscale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When saving the image (as 
\family typewriter
.png
\family default
), don't forget to save the transparent color (IrfanView has an option to
 save it in the save dialog).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Images with a smooth round border should have the background colorized to
 the target background color; otherwise, the results will not be perfect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important: you must set the button colors before calling 
\family typewriter
setBorder()
\family default
.
 Here's a sample: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Button btn = new Button("Barbara
\backslash
nHazan", new Image("button1.png"), CENTER, 8);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Itn.setBackColor(backColor);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

btn.borderColor3DG = 0x008800; // used to colorize the image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

btn.setFont(font.asBold());
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

btn.setBorder(Button.BORDER_GRAY_IMAGE);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(btn,CENTER,CENTER); 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A button can be made sticky by setting the 
\family typewriter
isSticky
\family default
 field.
 It keeps pressed until the next click.
 Note that this disables 
\family typewriter
autoRepeat
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you create an image button and add a text using the 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 method, both of them will appear on the control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the button has an image, you can change the image that is displayed while
 the button is pressed by changing the 
\family typewriter
pressedImage
\family default
 field.
 Below is a sample: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Image img = btn.getImage().getFrameInstance(0); // gets a copy of the image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

img.applyColor(Color.RED); // colorize as red
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

btn.pressedImage = img;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

// another option: btn.pressedImage = btn.getImage().getFadedInstance(Color.RED);
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you create an image for the button, make sure that it's a PNG with alpha-chan
nel (transparency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can make a button fire more than one event while it is pressed changing
 the field 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

autoRepeat
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
PRESSED
\family default
 event will be sent while this button is held.
 The field 
\family typewriter
INITIAL_ DELAY
\family default
 is the initial delay to start the auto-repeat, which defaults to 600 ms,
 and the field 
\family typewriter
AUTO_DELAY
\family default
 is the frequency in which the 
\family typewriter
PRESSED
\family default
 event will be posted after the 
\family typewriter
INITIAL_ DELAY
\family default
 was reached, which defaults to 150 ms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter
setImage()
\family default
 (sets the image that is displayed in the button; the
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

transparentColor
\family default
 property of the 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 must be set before calling this method) and 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 don't resize the button to fit the image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method is ignored by the 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The class 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 has the static field 
\family typewriter
commonGap
\family default
.
 It defines the internal gap between the button content and its borders.
 Changing this value affects all buttons created after the new value was
 set – it does not affect buttons previously created.
 This is useful when you're creating the buttons but don't want to keep
 calling the 
\family typewriter
setGap()
\family default
 method.
 Note that this value will be added to the value of gap.
 A good practice is to set the field for the desired value before you create
 the buttons (at the beginning of 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 for instance) and reset it back to zero after you finish (at the end of
 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
).
 Changing this also affects the size of the 
\family typewriter
ScrollBars
\family default
 created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can change the color used when the button is pressed using the 
\family typewriter
setPressedColor()
\family default
 method.
 This changes the color that the button's background will go ('armed color')
 when the button gets a 
\family typewriter
PENDOWN
\family default
 event.
 The default is the cursor color for the background.
 In Android user interface style, using a bright color may result in a white
 background.
 Use a darker color in this case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can simulate the button being pressed by calling the method 
\family typewriter
press()
\family default
 and passing 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 as parameter.
 Passing 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 simulates a release.
 This method does not generate events.

Here are some other features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two constructors: the default (with no arguments) that creates
 an edit with no constraints, and one constructor that receives a mask string.
 The mask is used, primarily, to compute the preferred width.
 If the mask is "", the width will be set to 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
.
 In order to use the mask to format the input, you must call the 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
 method passing 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to the second argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can limit the maximum length of characters that can be entered, by using
 the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

setMaxLength()
\family default
 method.
 If the user tries to enter text above the limit, a beep is sounded and
 the text is ignored.
 If you set a text greater than the maximum length, it will be truncated.

\begin_layout Itemize
There's another 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
 method that, besides the constants listed above, also receives a boolean
 to make the edit use a mask on the input text instead of popping a window.
 It should be used with the constants 
\family typewriter
DATE
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To retrieve the text shown as is, use 
\family typewriter
getText()
\family default
.
 If masking is enabled, the text with the mask is returned.
 You can return the text without the mask using 
\family typewriter
getTextWithoutMask()
\family default
.
 For non-currency mode, only characters whose corresponding mask is '9'
 are returned.
 To set the text to another one, call 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
.
 One of the 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 methods has a flag to indicate whether to post a 
\family typewriter
PRESSED
\family default
 event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To return the length of a text without having to call 
\family typewriter
getText()
\family default
, you can call 
\family typewriter
getLength()
\family default
.
 To apply trimming in the string and return its length, call 
\family typewriter
getTrimmedLength()
\family default
.
 This method consumes less memory than 
\family typewriter
getText().trim().length()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setDecimalPlaces()
\family default
 can be used with 
\family typewriter
setMode(CURRENCY, true)
\family default
 to set the number of decimal places the mask will use.
 The default value is 2.
 It cannot be used with masked edits; pass the number of decimal places
 in the mask itself.
 The only exception is when you want to use the default 
\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
 mask passing a 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 mask in the constructor; in this situation, you can call 
\family typewriter
setDecimalPlaces()
\family default
 before calling 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
, and a mask will be constructed with the given number of decimals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The edit can be set as read-only using the method 
\family typewriter
setEditable()
\family default
 and setting it to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
 You can also set the field 
\family typewriter
hasCursorWhenNotEditable
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 to make the blinking cursor not appear when this edit is not editable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There's a public member named 
\family typewriter
overwrite
\family default
 which, if set to 
\family typewriter

 e., characters will be replaced if written over).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The member 
\family typewriter

\family default
, which can be set to 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, lets you control the alignment of the text inside the edit after the control
 loses the focus.
 The text is always left-aligned when it has the focus.
 The only exception is when mode is set to 
\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
, when the numbers will be typed using right-align.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can invoke the default popup keyboard for the edit using the 
\family typewriter
popupKCC()
\family default
 method (KCC = Keyboard, Calculator, and Calendar).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may specify which keyboard will be popped up, overriding the default
 behavior, using the 
\family typewriter
setKeyboard()
\family default
 method, passing the constants 
\family typewriter
KBD_NONE
\family default
 (no keyboard will be popped up for this edit), 
\family typewriter
KBD_DEFAULT
\family default
 (the default keyboard for the current mode will be used for this edit)
 , 
\family typewriter
KBD_KEYBOARD
\family default
 (the 
\family typewriter
Keyboard
\family default
 class or the internal virtual keyboard will be used for this edit), 
\family typewriter
KBD_CALCULATOR
\family default

\family typewriter
KBD_CALENDAR
\family default
 (the

\family typewriter
KBD_NUMERIC
\family default
 (the

\family typewriter
KBD_TIME
\family default
 (the 
\family typewriter

\family default
 will be used for this edit).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Note that 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
calls 
\family typewriter
setKeyboard(KBD_DEFAULT)
\family default
, so be sure to set the mode before calling 
\family typewriter
setKeyboard()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may force all characters entered to be automatically converted to upper
 or to lower case by setting the field 
\family typewriter
capitalise
\family default
 with the constants 
\family typewriter
ALL_UPPER
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ALL_LOWER
\family default
; the constant 
\family typewriter
ALL_NORMAL
\family default
 disables this feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The field 
\family typewriter
autoSelect
\family default
 makes the edit automatically select the text when it receives the focus.
 This is always 
\family typewriter

\family default
 for penless devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setCursorPos(start, end)
\family default
 can be used to set the selected text of the edit (if 
\family typewriter
start != end
\family default
).
 It can be used to set the cursor position, if 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 equals 
\family typewriter
end
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 must be less or equal to 
\family typewriter
end
\family default
, and both must be 
\family typewriter
>= 0
\family default
.
 It can also be used to clear the selected text, calling 
\family typewriter
setCursorPos(-1,0)
\family default
.
 Note: if you're setting the cursor position before the edit is drawn for
 the first time, the edit will not be scrolled if the end position goes
 beyond the limits.
 Important! No bound checking is made.
 Be sure to not call this method with invalid positions! Example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ed.setText("1234567890123456");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ed.setCursorPos(3,14);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ed.requestFocus(); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
getCursorPos()
\family default
 returns an integer array 
\family typewriter
(int[])
\family default
 with the start (array index 0) and end (array index 1) positions of the
 cursor.
 It can be used to find the selected text with 
\family typewriter
getText()
\family default
, which will be the 
\family typewriter
substring(start, end)
\family default
.
 Example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int []cursorPos = ed.getCursorPos();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int start = cursorPos[0];
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int end = cursorPos[1];
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String text = ed.getText();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (start != -1) // is the text selected?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	String selectedText = text.substring(start,end);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a selection is made or when the user clicks and holds an edit at the
 same point, a popup menu is shown so the user can cut/copy/paste.
 You can disable this feature by calling 
\family typewriter
Edit.clipboardDelay = -1
\family default
.
 This field can also be used to define the time that the user will have
 to press to see a popup menu with copy/paste options, which defaults to
 1500 ms.
 It also affects 
\family typewriter
MultiEdit
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the Android user interface style, you can change the color of the edit
 that has focus using the 
\family typewriter
focusColor
\family default
 field.
 By default, there's only a blinking cursor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can remap a key to be used in the edit (for example, remap F1 to 1,
 F2 to 2, etc) by calling the 
\family typewriter
mapKeys(String from, String to)
\family default
 method.
 This method maps the keys in the 
\family typewriter
from
\family default
 character array into the keys in the 
\family typewriter
to
\family default
 character array.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, to enable a 'numeric pad' on devices that has the 
\family typewriter
1
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter
u
\family default
 character, you can use this: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ed.mapKeys("uiojklnm!.","1234567890");
\end_layout

\end_inset

To make sure that lowercase characters are also handled, you should also
 change the capitalise mode: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ed.capitalise = Edit.ALL_LOWER;
\end_layout

\end_inset

If you want to disable a set of keys, use the 
\family typewriter
setValidChars()
\family default
 method.
 Note that 
\family typewriter
mapKeys()
\family default
 have precendence over 
\family typewriter
setValidChars()
\family default
.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\family typewriter
from
\family default
 parameter must have the same length of 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 Set it to 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 to disable mapping.

Here are some other features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Label has three constructors: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Label()
\family default
 Creates an empty label, using 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
 as the preferred width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Label(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text)
\family default
 Creates a label displaying the given text (that may be changed at runtime)
 using left alignment.
 Supports inverted text, multiple lines and is scrollable by default.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Label(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

align)
\family default
 Like the above, but you can also set the horizontal alignment using one
 of the constants 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
 (justified).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The three align constants are inherited from the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
 class, where they are used in the 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 method.
 Furthermore, you can use
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
new label(“my text”, Label.CENTER)
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
new Label(“my text”, CENTER)
\family default
; it will work in the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The vertical alignment can be controlled using the 
\family typewriter
vAlign
\family default
 field.
 Defaults to 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The text is used to compute the preferred size.
 If you pass an empty string as text, the preferred width will be 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can set/change the label's text alignment accessing the public member
 
\family typewriter
align
\family default
.
 The possible values are 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
 (justifies the text).
 If align is 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
 and the text is wider than the label, only the right portion will be lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can call the 
\family typewriter
set3d()
\family default
 method to make the label have a 3d look, by drawing it with the foreground
 color and with a color a little brighter than the background color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Labels can look inverted, by swapping the background and the foreground
 colors.
 To do this, use the 
\family typewriter
setInvert()
\family default
 method.
 By calling it twice you can make the text blink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The text can be highlighted using the 
\family typewriter
setHighlighted()
\family default
 method.
 This method paints the text in all directions with a brighter color, then
 centered, with the foreground color.
 The highlight color can be set using 
\family typewriter
setHighlightedColor()
\family default
.
 The default color is a brighter foreground color.
 -1 must be passed to the method to use this default value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Labels can’t be inverted and 3d at the same time.
 Calling 
\family typewriter
set3d()
\family default
 cancels 
\family typewriter
setInverted()
\family default
 and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the label is a multi-line one, you can use the method 
\family typewriter
scroll(boolean down)
\family default
 to make it scroll up and down, and also the 
\family typewriter
canScroll(boolean down)
\family default
 method to peek if it can be scrolled in the desired direction.
 A label can scroll if the number of text lines is greater than the actual
 height.
 To see a good usage example of this feature, see the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.
 dialog.MessageBox
\family default
 class.
 By default, the scroll is done a page at a time; to scroll a line at a
 time, change the 
\family typewriter
pageScroll
\family default
 field to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
scroll()
\family default
 returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if success; 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 if no scroll is possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, the 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method does not affect the label's text because clearing a label is usually
 not a desired action.
 If you really want to clear it, you must explicitly set the 
\family typewriter
clearValueStr
\family default
 property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 method, used to change the label’s text, does not change the control’s
 bounds.
 You must be sure that the label has enough size to hold the text otherwise
 it will be clipped.
 If you're setting the text in 
\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
 mode, the text must be set not formatted (unmasked).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, this class does not automatic parses the text because this is
 a slow operation.
 You may change this behaviour by using the 
\family typewriter
autoSplit
\family default
 field, or calling the 
\family typewriter
split()
\family default
 method directly.
 This method splits the text to the given width.
 Remember to set the font (or add the label to its parent) before calling
 this method.
 You can also you can use a handy method to parse the text that you want
 to display: see the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.Convert.insertLineBreak()
\family default
 method.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Set 
\family typewriter
autoSplit
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to let the label split its text based on the width every time its width
 changes.
 If the height is 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED
\family default
, the label will change its size accordingly.
 You may change the height again calling 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setMarqueeText(String text, int delay, int loopCount, int step)
\family default
 shows the label as a horizontal marquee.
 The text must have a single line (if it has more than one line, only the
 first line is shown).
 To stop the marquee, just call 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

setText()
\family default
.
 When a window covers the marquee, it is halted, and resumed when the window
 is closed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
delay
\family default
 is the timer delay in ms used to scroll the marquee, where 100 ms is a
 good value.
 
\family typewriter
loopCount
\family default
 is the number of times the text will loop.
 Set to -1 to loop forever.
 When the loop count is reached, the text is cleared.
 Finally, 
\family typewriter
step
\family default
 is the step in pixels in which the text will be scrolled.
 If 
\family typewriter
step > 0
\family default
, the scroll will be from left to right; if 
\family typewriter
step < 0
\family default
, the scroll will be from right to left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have problems with labels when a rotation occurs, check the 
\family typewriter
preferredWidthText
\family default
 field.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

By default, the 
\family typewriter
getPreferredWidth()
\family default
 uses the current text to compute the width.
 However, if you create a label with a predefined text that will be changed
 later, in the advent of a reposition, the preferred width will be recomputed
 again using the current text and not the predefined one.
 For example, if you do: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Label l = new Label("99");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

l.setText("0");
\end_layout

\end_inset

then the preferred width will be computed based on "0", not in "99".
 To change this behaviour, assign to this field the text that you want to
 be used to compute the preferred width.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can add a border to the label by changing the 
\family typewriter
borderColor
\family default
 field.
 Defaults to -1, which means no border.
 Note that the border affects the label's size (width and height are increased
 by 4), so you must set this field before setting the rect.
 If you want a bigger gap between border and text, you can use 
\family typewriter
setInsets(int left, int right, int top, int bottom)
\family default
, which defines a space to be placed around the text of the label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The background can be changed from solid (defaults to 
\family typewriter
SOLID_BACKGROUND
\family default
) to a shade by using the 
\family typewriter
backgroundType
\family default
 field.
 The other values can be 
\family typewriter
VERTICAL_GRADIENT_ BACKGROUND
\family default
 (specifies a vertical 3d-gradient background for this label) and 
\family typewriter
HORIZONTAL_ GRADIENT_BACKGROUND
\family default
 (specifies a horizontal 3d-gradient background for this label).
 One color is the background color, and the other color is defined by 
\family typewriter
firstGradientColor
\family default
 (defaults to 
\family typewriter
Color.WHITE
\family default
) and 
\family typewriter
secondGradientColor
\family default
 (defaults to 
\family typewriter
Color.BLACK
\family default
) fields.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter

It has two constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

RadioGroupController
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

radioGroup)
\family default
 Creates a radio control displaying the given text and attached to the given
 radio group.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
radioGroupController
\family default
 is not a control, therefore you cannot add it to a container and it does
 not post events since it does not extend 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
.
 It just provides useful methods to handle groups of radio controls, like:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add(Radio
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

newMember)
\family default
 Adds a new 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 to the list of 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
s this controller handles.
 This method is called by the 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
's constructor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
remove(Radio
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

oldMember)
\family default
 Removes the given 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 from the list of 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
s this controller handles.
 You must explicitly call this method, if needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getSelectedIndex()
\family default
 Returns the index of the selected 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 (in the order that the 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
s were added to the container), or -1 if none.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setSelectedIndex(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

index)
\family default
 Used to select a 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 by its index and deselects the other one.
 The parameter 
\family typewriter
index
\family default
 is a zero-based index of the 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 to be set.
 -1 must be passed to disable all of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getSelectedItem()
\family default
 Returns the 
\family typewriter

\family default
 selected, or 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 if none.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setSelectedItem(Radio
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

who)
\family default
 Selects a given radio group controller.
 It is called by the 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 when a click was made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setSelectedItem(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text)
\family default
 Selects a 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 whose text matches the given caption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getRadio(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

idx)
\family default
 Returns the 
\family typewriter
Radio
\family default
 at the given index.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These indices are based in the order that the radios are added to the container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may use the 
\family typewriter
getRadioGroupController()
\family default
 method to make it easier to parse the events.
 It returns the 
\family typewriter
RadioGroupController
\family default
 that this radio belongs to, or 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 if none.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The check's text is right justified in the control's width by default.
 You may change this behavior by setting the field 
\family typewriter
leftJustify
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if the width is above the preferred one.
 This will make the text to be left justified in the control's width.

\begin_layout Itemize
To change the check's color, which defaults to the foreground color, use
 the 
\family typewriter
checkColor
\family default

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
ComboBox
\family default
 class has four constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ComboBox()
\family default
 Creates an empty combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ComboBox(ListBox
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

userListBox)
\family default
 Creates a combo box with a 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 containing the given list box.
 You can extend 
\family typewriter
ListBox
\family default
 to draw the items by yourself and use this constructor so the pop list
 will use your class and not the default 
\family typewriter
ListBox
\family default
 one.
 This constructor forces 
\family typewriter
ListBox.simpleBorder
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
 Note: the list box items must be already set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ComboBox(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items)
\family default
 Creates a combo box with the given items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ComboBox(ComboBoxDropDown
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

userPopList)
\family default
 Constructs a combo box with the given 
\family typewriter
ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 already filled.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The combo box drop down control is placed above or below the combo box,
 without covering it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 height depends on the control's position: it will open in the direction
 that has the most space left (above or below).
 If you set the public member 
\family typewriter
fullHeight
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
, then it will have the same height as the screen, maximizing the number
 of items displayed.
 In the same way, the 
\family typewriter
fullWidth
\family default
 will set the width to the screen's one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method selects the index using the 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt
\family default
 value, which is 0 by default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The color used in the 
\family typewriter
setBackground()
\family default
 method will be used in the arrow button only.
 The background color of the combo box text and 
\family typewriter
ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 will be a lighter version of the given color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can change the combo box's scroll bar default width.
 To do so, you must use the static field 
\family typewriter
Button.commonGap
\family default
.
 Increasing its value will also increase the width of the arrow button and
 the scrollbar.
 Remember to reset the 
\family typewriter
Button.commonGap
\family default
 value to 0 after the combo box creation, otherwise it will keep affecting
 all combo box and buttons created after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may append new items to your combo box using the method 
\family typewriter
add()
\family default
, which has three useful implementations:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

item)
\family default
 Adds an object to the combo box.
 This method is very slow if used in loop; use the 
\family typewriter
add(Object[] items)
\family default
 to add a bunch of objects instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items)
\family default
 Adds an array of objects to the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

startAt,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

size)
\family default
 Adds a subarray of objects to the combo box.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You may insert new items at a desired position using 
\family typewriter
insert(Object item, int index)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setItemAt(int i, Object s)
\family default
 replaces the object at the given index starting from zero by the given
 object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
size()
\family default
 to retrieve the number of items available on the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
getItemAt(int i)
\family default
 returns the object at the selected index; the reverse operation can be
 done with 
\family typewriter
indexOf(Object name)
\family default
, which retrieves the index of a specific object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
getSelectedIndex()
\family default
 to get the index of the selected item, or 
\family typewriter
getSelectedItem()
\family default
 to retrieve the selected object directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may select an item by its index with 
\family typewriter
setSelectedIndex(int i)
\family default
 or by its content with 
\family typewriter
setSelectedItem(Object name)
\family default
.
 In the first, -1 must be used to blank the combo box view box.
 In the last one, if the name is not found, the currently selected item
 is not changed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
selectLast()
\family default
 method selects the last item added to the combo box, doing a scroll if
 needed.
 It calls 
\family typewriter
repaintNow()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To remove items from a combo box, you may use one of the following three
 methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
remove(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

itemIndex)
\family default
 Removes an object from the combo box by its index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
remove(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

item)
\family default
 Removes the given object from the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeAll()
\family default
 Empties the combo box.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The combo box items can be sorted using the methods 
\family typewriter
qsort()
\family default
.
 One of them receives a parameter indicating if the sorting is caseless
 or not in case the elements are strings.
 In both of them, the current selection is cleared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to make a list box scroll horizontally (see 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:ListBox"

\end_inset


\family default
).
 To be able to scroll the list box associated with this combo box, just
 call the method 
\family typewriter
enableHorizontalScroll()
\family default
.
 Two buttons will appear below the vertical scrollbar.
 The add, replace, and remove operations will be a bit slower because the
 string's width will have to be computed in order to correctly set the maximum
 horizontal scroll.

The list box is a control that allows the user to select one item from a
 list contained within multiple line text box.
 It looks like an open combo box (in fact, the combo box uses the list box
 control).
 Consider using the list box instead of the combo box if the screen has
 enough space available to show all items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some screenshots from a simple list box using the Android style
 from the old UIControls sample (now inside the 
\family typewriter

\family default
 package from the TotalCrossAPI sample).
 Note that above the list box component, there is a combo box:

 replaces the object at the given index by the given object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method

 returns the object at the selected index.
 It returns an empty string if the index is outside the range.
 The reverse operation can be done with 
\family typewriter
indexOf(Object name)

, which retrieves the index of a specific object.
 It returns -1 if the object is not found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Itemize
To remove items from a list box, you may use one of the following three
 methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
remove(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

itemIndex)
\family default
 Removes an object from the list box by its index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
remove(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

item)
\family default
 Removes the given object from the list box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeAll()
\family default
 Empties the list box, setting all elements of the array to 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 so they can be garbage collected.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Attention! If you used the same object array to initialize two list boxes
 (or combo boxes), this method will 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 both list boxes (because they use the same array reference), and you might
 get a 
\family typewriter
NullPointerException
\family default
! 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The list box items can be sorted using the method 
\family typewriter
qsort()
\family default
.
 One of them receives a parameter indicating if the sorting is caseless
 or not in case the elements are strings.
 In both of them, the current selection is cleared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To add a horizontal scroll to the list box, use the method 
\family typewriter
enableHorizontalScroll()
\family default
.
 Note that enabling this will make the addition of elements slower, because
 the list box will compute each item's width to find the maximum offset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To increase the default height of the horizontal scroll buttons, change
 the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

extraHorizScrollButtonHeight
\family default
 static member.
 Its default value is 2 in 160x160 or a multiple of it in other resolutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
setSimpleBorder(boolean simpleBorder)
\family default
 method is used to change the border style from 3d to simple if the flag
 passed is 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the list box owns the focus and you type a letter, the first item with
 the typed letter is selected.
 Typing again selects the next item, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The up/down keys can be used to scroll the list box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The selection color can be changed with 
\family typewriter
setCursorColor(int color)
\family default
.
 The color used in the 
\family typewriter
setBackColor()
\family default
 method will be used in the scrollbar only.
 The background color of the control will be a lighter version of the given
 color.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, the selection is drawn using the current item's width.
 This behavior can be changed by setting the static field 
\family typewriter
useFullWidthOnSelection
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
 If so, all list boxes will have the selection bar drawn in the full width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can extend 
\family typewriter
ListBox
\family default
 to implement a customized type, like a color-chooser list box.
 If doing so, the following methods must be overridden:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to add and remove a control, respectively, do nothing, because it does
 not make sense to add controls to or remove controls from a list box.

Be careful when setting the items with an object array.
 The array is assigned as is, no copy is made.
 So, if you use the same array in another control and an item inside the
 array is changed, this change will reflect in both controls.
 However, if you add a new item, a new array is created to store the added
 item and the program works correctly.
 The best practice is to have one array for each list box control.
 To copy the contents of an object array to a new one, you can use 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.Vm.arrayCopy()
\family default
.
 If you're dealing specifically with string arrays, you may instead use
 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.Convert.cloneStringArray()
\family default
.

	String s = "James Robert Baker (1946-1997) was an American author of sharply
 satirical, predominantly gay-themed transgressional fiction.
 A native Californian, his work is set almost entirely in Southern California.
 After graduating from UCLA, he began his career as a screenwriter, but
 became disillusioned and started writing novels instead.
 Though he garnered fame for his books Fuel-Injected Dreams and Boy Wonder,
 after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, Tim And Pete,
 he faced increasing difficulty having his work published.
 According to his life partner, this was a contributing factor in his suicide.
 Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and
 two additional novels have been posthumously published.
 First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items.
 One of his novels was filmed (though it was not a financial success) and
 two others have been optioned for the movies, though they have not been
 produced.";

Although the TotalCross' grid control usage is pretty simple and straightforward
, it is the most customizable control and it uses its own set of events
 defined in 
\family typewriter
GridEvent
\family default
s (unlike the almost all the other controls that use only 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent
\family default
s).
 That means you'll be able to start using grids within a couple of minutes,
 but it will take some time to learn to use all its features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Horizontal scrolling in case the columns widths are greater than the screen
 width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vertical scrollbar to scroll up and down the information on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An easy to use interface for adding/removing information to the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optional check column which is a column that is clickable, marking an specific
 row as checked/ unchecked; this is usefull if you want the user to be able
 to select multiple rows displayed on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Columns can be resized so that the user can see all the information displayed
 in a given column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Style configuration, which you can set the color of captions boxes all the
 way through the stripes colors and vertical line types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
GridEvent
\family default
 class contains the events generated by the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A column may be marked as editable.
 In this case, an edit will be placed in the currently focused cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A column can also have choices (combo box).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The columns can be sorted by clicking on the title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the text is bigger than the size of the column, you can click and hold
 in the cell to display a tooltip with the full text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can customize cell back and fore colors, enabled state and choices by
 using the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Clicking on the column's caption will sort in ascending order; clicking
 on it again sorts in descending order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to assign a 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A column with size 0 is not displayed, so you can use it to store in the
 grid important information, for example the 
\family typewriter

checkEnabled)
\family default
 Creates a grid with the given captions and, optionally, a multi-selection
 check column so that the user can select multiple rows of the grid.
 The captions can't be 
\family typewriter

 and, optionally, a multi-selection check column.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the total width is less than the grid's width, the last column will fill
 until the grid width.
 If

\family default
, the caption widths will be computed and used as the row width.
 If a negative value is passed, it will be computed as a percentage against
 the grid's width.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\family typewriter
aligns
\family default
 is the alignment of information on the given column.
 If

\family default
.
 If it is 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, the items at index 
\family typewriter
row
\family default
 will be shown in 
\family typewriter
row+1
\family default
 and the items at index 
\family typewriter
row+1
\family default
 will be shown at index 
\family typewriter

\family default
 assigned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
del(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items
\family default
) Sets the grid items to be displayed.
 Notice that it needs to conform to the numbers of columns that the grid
 currently have.
 This method removes any assigned 
\family typewriter
DataSource
\family default
.
 The strings inside the matrix cannot be 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
.
 If 
\family typewriter
items == null
\family default

\family default
 Returns the number of rows in this grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setColumnEditable(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

col,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

editable
\family default
) Enables/disables the edition for all cells of a grid's column.
 Note that setting an editable column as not editable will remove all its
 formats.
 Returns the previous edit or the new one, so you can easily change its
 formats.
 Important: this must be called AFTER the grid has set its bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
isColumnEditable(int
\begin_inset space ~

choices)
\family default
 Enables a combo box with choices for all cells of a grid's column.
 The given choice array is used to create a pop list that is shown when
 the user clicks on the column.
 Note that calling this method removes any edit assigned to this column.
 You can change dynamically the choices by extending the 
\family typewriter
CellController
\family default
 class.
 Passing a 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 value removes any combo box assigned to the column.

\family default
 if none was found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeAll()
\family default
 This method does nothing.
 To remove all elements, 
\family typewriter
removeAllElements()
\family default
 should be used instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

nrItems)
\family default
 Passing the class that implements the 
\family typewriter
Grid.DataSource
\family default
 interface and the total number of items allows the grid to request data
 on demand.
 This greatly reduces the memory usage, because only the number of visible
 items may be loaded at each time, but makes the grid navigation slower.
 Note that in this mode the grid scroll will not be realtime: the data will
 be requested only when the user releases the scroll bar.
 The data source has a single method: 
\family typewriter
String[][] getItems(int startingRow, int count)
\family default
, that must return the given number of items or less.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\family typewriter
remove()
\family default

 A 
\family typewriter
DataSource
\family default
 is mostly used to assign a 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to it, so it's nonsense any data modification.
 Note that the scroll is made not live scrolling to speedup data retrieval.

\begin_layout Section
ToolTip 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It allows the display of a tooltip when user keeps the pen in the control.
 On Windows and Linux desktop, the tooltip is also shown when the mouse
 stays over a control.
 The default popup delay (
\family typewriter
millisDelay
\family default
) is 1000 ms and the amount of time it will be displayed (
\family typewriter
millisDisplay
\family default
) is 2000 ms (a pen up also hides the control).
 The tooltip must always be added after the control is added and had its
 bounds set; otherwise, you must call the added method to initialize the
 tip's bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can set the border color by changing the 
\family typewriter
borderColor
\family default
 field (no border by default) and also the internal gap (the field 
\family typewriter
insideGap
\family default
).
 By default, it is -1 and no border is shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The static members 
\family typewriter
distX
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
distY
\family default
 lets you set the default distance from the control for all tooltips.
 They must be set before the tooltip is created and are 0 by default.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constructor receives the control which the tooptip refers to and the
 message that will be displayed.
 You can use the new line character 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 like a label control.
 Example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ToolTip t = new ToolTip(control, "Hi!
\backslash
nIt's Me"); 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.PRESSED
\family default
 event will be dispatched to the attached control right before the text
 is shown.
 You can then set the tip to a new value using 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
; setting to an empty string will disable the tooltip at that moment.
 Calling 
\family typewriter
setControlRect()
\family default
 also changes the rectangle around which the tooltip will be displayed.
 By default, it's used the absolute rectangle of the control passed in the
 constructor.
 The placement of the tooltip will be defined based on it, in a way that
 the control is not obscured.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug(b1.toString());
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug(b2.toString());
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug(b3.toString());
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug(b4.toString());
\end_layout

\end_inset

prints the following on the console:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Section
Bar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Bar
\family default
 is a class that provides a title area and a button area (at right).
 The title and the button are optional, although it doesn't make sense to
 have a bar without title and buttons.
 You can add or remove buttons, and change the title text; the title text
 can have an icon at left.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a button is pressed, a 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.PRESSED
\family default
 is sent to the caller, and the button index can be retrieved using the
 
\family typewriter
getSelectedIndex()
\family default
 method.
 By default, the background is shaded (
\family typewriter
BACKGROUND_SHADED
\family default
).
 You can change it to plain using 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

backgroundStyle = BACKGROUND_SOLID;
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of how to use it: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Font f = Font.getFont(true,Font.NORMAL_SIZE+2);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Bar h1 = new Bar("fakeboot");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.canSelectTitle = true;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.setFont(f);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.setBackForeColors(0x0A246A,Color.WHITE);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.addButton(new Image("ic_dialog_alert.png"));
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.addButton(new Image("ic_dialog_info.png"));
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(h1, LEFT,0,FILL,PREFERRED); // use 0 instead of TOP to overwrite the
 default menu area 
\end_layout

\end_inset

which results in the following images using Android style, where the bottom
 images show the title and one of the buttons being pressed:

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the top and bottom components of the the old UIControls sample
 (now inside the 
\family typewriter
ui
\family default
 package from the TotalCrossAPI sample) are bars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also add a spinner to the bar and manipulate it using the following
 methods: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
createSpinner(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

color)
\family default
 Creates a spinner with the given color.
 The spinner will be placed at the right of the title (only works if there's
 a title).
 It must be created before the bar is added to a container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
startSpinner()
\family default
 Shows and starts the spinner (if one has been assigned to the spinner field).
 If there is no spinner, a 
\family typewriter
NullPointerException
\family default
 will be thrown.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Changing the code of the example given above after line 7 results in:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

h1.createSpinner(Color.WHITE);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(h1, LEFT,0,FILL,PREFERRED); // use 0 instead of TOP to overwrite the

\begin_layout Section
ButtonMenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class adds a multi-button menu that can be scrolled horizontally (single-ro
w) or vertically (multiple-rows), using a scroll bar or flicking.
 The buttons can have almost all properties present in the 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 class, like (the 
\family typewriter
ButtonMenu
\family default
 fields listed below similar to the ones in the class 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 are ommited from the fields description at the end of this section):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also other properties that can be set, like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
textGap 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
buttonVertGap 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
buttonHorizGap 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
imageSize 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
borderGap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sizes above are not in pixels, but in percentage of the font's height.
 So, a value of 25 means 25% of the font's height, or 1/4; 150 means 150%
 of the font's height, or 1.5x; and so on.
 This enabled the gaps be constant in physical inches no matter the screen
 DPI or resolution.

 The menu can be closed by a click on a valid item or clicking outside of
 its bounds.
 A 
\family typewriter
PRESSED
\family default
 event will be thrown when the menu is closed and a menu item was selected.
 To discover which item was selected, see the method 
\family typewriter
getSelectedIndex()
\family default
, which returns -1 if none, or the matrix index otherwise.

\begin_layout Section
Spacer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Control used to add a space between controls.
 It shows nothing on screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a sample of how to use it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Spacer s = new Spacer("  ");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Button btnClear = new Button("Clear");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Button btnOK = new Button("OK");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(s, CENTER,AFTER+2);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(btnClear, AFTER,SAME, s);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

add(btnOK, BEFORE, SAME, SAME, SAME, s); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

which results in the following using Android style, which places two buttons
 centered on screen, like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SpinList
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Creates a control with two arrows, so that you can scroll values and show
 the current one.
 It supports auto-scroll (by clicking and holding) and can also dynamically
 compute the items based on ranges.
 The spin list can be horizontal or vertical.
 You can use something like: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

SpinList sl = new SpinList(..., !Settings.fingerTouch); 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way, in finger-touch devices, it will use the horizontal appearance,
 which is easier to deal with on such devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Spinner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Spinner
\family default
 is a control that shows an image indicating that something is running in
 the background.
 It has two styles: 
\family typewriter
IPHONE
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ANDROID
\family default
.
 It's used in the 
\family typewriter
ProgressBox
\family default
 and can be used in the 
\family typewriter
Bar
\family default
.
 To start the spin call the 
\family typewriter
start()
\family default
 method, and to stop it call the 
\family typewriter
stop()
\family default
 method.
 An image of it has already been shown in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
TabbedContainer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
TabbedContainer
\family default
 is a bar of text or image tabs.
 It is assumed that all images will have the same height, but they may have
 different widths.
 A scroll is automatically added when the total width of the titles is bigger
 than the control's width.
 The containers are created automatically and switched when the user presses
 the corresponding tab.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the user interface has Android style, the tabs do not look good if
 the background is the same of the parent's.
 In this case, we force the background to be slighly darker.
 There are a few fields that you can use to change the color, like 
\family typewriter
activeTabBackColor
\family default
,
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

useOnTabTheContainerColor
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Important: with 
\family typewriter
Settings.fingerTouch = true
\family default
, you CANNOT call 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 in your container.
 Otherwise, the flick and drag will not work and your container will be
 positioned incorrectly.

\begin_layout Chapter
The Window class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you already know, a TotalCross program with user interface consists of
 one and only one main window (a class that directly or indirecly extends
 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
).
 This main window can pop up a window, and this new window can pop up another
 one, and so on.
 Windows in TotalCross are always modal, therefore, only the last popped
 up window can receive events and you cannot switch from the topmost Window
 to the previous without closing the topmost one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class extends 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
, you can't add a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 to a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
.
 Doing this results in a 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
.
 To show a window, you must use the method 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 or the method 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following example creates a popup window class: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class TestWindow extends Window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	public TestWindow()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		super("Test",RECT_BORDER); // with caption and borders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		setRect(CENTER,CENTER,Settings.screenWidth/2,Settings.screenHeight/4);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		add(btnHi=new Button("Hi!"),CENTER,CENTER);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	public void onEvent(Event event)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			unpop(); // a WINDOW_CLOSED event will be posted to this PARENT window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use it non-blocking (the execution continues right after the popup command,
 even with the window still open): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public class Launcher extends MainWindow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	TestWindow tw;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	public void initUI()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		tw = new TestWindow();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		tw.popupNonBlocking(); // this line is executed immediately
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	public void onEvent(Event event)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			// any stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blocking popup may be use in 
\family typewriter
InputBox
\family default
/
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 classes, while non-blocking popup is used in 
\family typewriter
MenuBar
\family default
 and other classes.
 Important note: you can't use 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 with a delay to unpop it.
 In this case, the correct would be to use 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mb = new MessageBox(...);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mb.popupNonBlocking();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.sleep(5000); // or do something else
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mb.unpop(); 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 in this specific case, the VM will hang.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some other features of the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows can have a title that can be set by the method 
\family typewriter
setTitle(String title)
\family default
 (which calls 
\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
) or passed to the constructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The window border can be selected from one of the multiple styles shown
 below, by using the 
\family typewriter
setBorderStyle(byte borderStyle)
\family default
 method or passing the desired style to the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 constructor.
 The parameter value can be 
\family typewriter
NO_BORDER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RECT_BORDER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ROUND_ BORDER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
TAB_BORDER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
TAB_ONLY_BORDER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
HORIZONTAL_GRADIENT
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
VERTICAL_ GRADIENT
\family default
.
 To retrive it, use 
\family typewriter
getBorderStyle()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two constructors: the default one, that creates a window with
 no title and no border, and one constructor with both title and border
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Window()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Window(String title, byte borderStyle)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Windows can be moved around the screen by dragging the window’s title.
 If the window has no title, it can’t be moved.
 You can make a titled window unmovable by calling the 
\family typewriter
makeUnmovable()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The title font can be changed using the 
\family typewriter
setTitleFont()
\family default
 method.
 To retrive it, use
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
getTitleFont()
\family default
.
 By default, the font is the one used by the main window, with bold style.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only one control can hold the focus at a time.
 To change focus to another control, use the 
\family typewriter
setFocus(Control c)
\family default
 method (this can also be done through the 
\family typewriter
requestFocus()
\family default
 method in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
 class).
 When a user types a key, the control with focus gets the key event.
 Calling this method will cause a 
\family typewriter
FOCUS_OUT
\family default
 control event to be posted to the window's current focus control (if one
 exists) and will cause a 
\family typewriter
FOCUS_IN
\family default
 control event to be posted to the new focus control.
 The 
\family typewriter
getFocus()
\family default
 method returns the control that currently owns the focus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rectangle area excluding the border and the title is defined as the
 client rectangle.
 You can get it with the 
\family typewriter
getClientRect()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A window can be popped up by calling the 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 method and can be unpopped by calling the 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method.
 The popup process saves the area behind the window that is being popped
 up and the unpop process restores that area.
 The 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method posts a 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 event to the caller window.
 The 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 method can be called like 
\family typewriter
this.popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
 Calling 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 when only the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 is active does nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A window can also be popped up by calling the 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 method, and be unpopped by the same 
\family typewriter
unpop() 
\family default
method described above.
 The big difference is that in 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, the program execution continues to the next line, while in 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
, the program execution is halted and only continues when the popped up
 window is dismissed.
 
\family typewriter
Menu
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ComboBox
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 are popped up using 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, because execution does not need to be halted.
 
\family typewriter
InputDialog
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Calendar
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
Calculator
\family default
 are usually popped up using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 because the user may want to get the result of the dialog in an easy way.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You can't use 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 to popup alternating windows that call each other recursively.
 For example, suppose that from 
\family typewriter
win1
\family default
 you call 
\family typewriter
win2.popup()
\family default
, then at 
\family typewriter
win2
\family default
 you call 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 and then 
\family typewriter
win1.popup()
\family default
.
 Then, from 
\family typewriter
win1
\family default
 you do 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 again and 
\family typewriter
win2.popup()
\family default
, and so on.
 This will lead to an 
\family typewriter
OutOfMemoryError
\family default
 on the device due to a native stack overflow.
 To fix this, just replace the popup by 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The topmost window (the one who receive events) can be obtained with the
 static method 
\family typewriter
getTopMost()
\family default
.
 To check if this window is the topmost, use the 
\family typewriter
isTopMost()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Try 
\family typewriter
setGrabPenEvents()
\family default
 for settting to a control to redirect all pen events directly to it.
 This method speeds up pen event processing.
 Used in 
\family typewriter
Whiteboard
\family default
 class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may check if this window is visible using the 
\family typewriter
isVisible()
\family default
 method.
 This method is inherited from 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
, but it simply checks if the current window is the topmost one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each window can have a menu attached by using the method 
\family typewriter
setMenuBar()
\family default
.
 The menuBar can be made visible programatically by calling the 
\family typewriter
popupMenuBar()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suppose you wish to allow the user to abort a task being executed by pressing.
 You can use the method 
\family typewriter
pumpEvents()
\family default
 to process all events in the queue.
 This method is used to implement a blocking Window.
 Here is an example: 
\begin_inset listings

The methods 
\family typewriter
getPreferredWidth()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
getPreferredHeight()
\family default
 have a special meaning for the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class.
 They return the minimum width/height needed for the correct display of
 this window.
 
\family typewriter
getPreferredWidth()
\family default
 returns the width of the title (if any) plus the width of the border (if
 any).
 
\family typewriter
getPreferredHeight()
\family default
 returns the height of the title (if any) plus the height of the border
 (if any).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some useful protected methods that may be implemented by controls
 that extend 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

totalcross.ui.Window

\family default
 This method is used in popup windows.
 If the user clicks outside the window’s bounds, this method is called giving
 the absolute coordinates of the clicked point.
 There are two options:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you had handled the action, return 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 in this method.
 Otherwise, 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 must be returned and if the 
\family typewriter
beepIfOut
\family default
 member is 
\family typewriter

\family default
, a beep is played (in other words, 
\family typewriter
beepIfOut

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
postPopup()
\family default
 Called after the popup process ended.
 When this method is called, the popped up window is fully functional.
 It is a good place to put a

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next is explained how controls inside a window are repainted: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The programmer calls the 
\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
 method of some controls, or a control is clicked and marks itself for repaint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
damageRect()
\family default
 method in class window creates a rectangle (stored in the 
\family typewriter
paintX
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
paintY
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
paintWidth
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
paintHeight
\family default
 members) with the union of the bounds of all controls marked for repaint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The next time a VM event is posted, the 
\family typewriter
_doPaint()
\family default
 method of the topmost window is called.
 This method paints the window’s title/border (if any) and calls the 
\family typewriter
onPaint()
\family default
 method of all containers and controls that lies inside the rectangle area
 marked for repaint.
 This explains why nothing in the window is updated when you receive events
 directly from a native library (the 
\family typewriter
Scanner
\family default
 class, for example).
 Because the VM is not receiving the event, it never validates the window.
 In these cases, you must update the window yourself, calling 
\family typewriter
repaintNow()
\family default
 or the validate methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many classes in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui
\family default
 package extend 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Window
\family default
.
 Examples of such classes are 
\family typewriter
CalculatorBox
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CalendarBox
\family default
.
 Other good examples are 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to be aware that it is not a good practice to create classes
 that extend 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 if they will occupy the whole screen, because they use a lot of memory
 to store the underlying area.
 Opening the menu may lead to time-consuming redraws of all opened windows
 due to out-of-memory problems.
 In these cases, it is better to use 
\family typewriter
Containers
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
UIColors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class contains the default colors used in most user interface windows,
 like 
\family typewriter
CalendarBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
KeyboardBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CalculatorBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
InputBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
, and also the default foreground and background colors of all controls
 created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no methods in this class, only public static members, which can
 be freely changed to meet your user interface color scheme.
 To correctly change the colors for your own, you must do it in the constructor
 of your application.
 Note that each member defines the default value for all controls of your
 application.

Interface Dialogs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK provides some handy interface dialogs, which are windows
 that handles common user interaction scenarios, like displaying an informative
 message or requesting a specific user input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interface dialogs are pop-up windows that extend the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class, and just like 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, they are not automatically displayed under creation.
 To show or hide a dialog you must use 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 methods: 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
.

\begin_layout Standard
The message box is displayed on the center of the device screen, and its
 bounds are calculated based on the given title, text and buttons.
 If the text height is above the screen limits, two arrows are added to
 the message box to allow the text scrolling.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
yPosition
\family default
 Defines the 
\family typewriter

\family default
 position on screen where the window opens.
 It can be changed to 
\family typewriter

\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BOTTOM
\family default
.
 Defaults to 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
buttonKeys
\family default
 If you set the 
\family typewriter
buttonCaptions
\family default
 array in the construction, you can also set this public field to an 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 array of the keys that maps to each of the buttons.
 For example, if you set the buttons to 
\family typewriter
{"Ok","Cancel"}
\family default
, you can map the enter key for the 
\family typewriter
Ok
\family default
 button and the escape key for the 
\family typewriter
Cancel
\family default
 button by assigning: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

buttonKeys = new int[]{SpecialKeys.ENTER,SpecialKeys.ESCAPE}; 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that 
\family typewriter
ENTER
\family default
 is also handled as 
\family typewriter
ACTION
\family default
, since the 
\family typewriter
ENTER
\family default
 key is mapped to 
\family typewriter
ACTION
\family default
 on some platforms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 has the following public instance methods (omitting some methods from its
 superclasses):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setText(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text)
\family default
 This method can be used to set the text AFTER the dialog was shown.
 However, the dialog will not be resized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setIcon(Image
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

icon)
\family default
 Sets an icon to be shown in the 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
's title, at left.
 It only works if there's a title.
 If you really need an empty title, pass as title a string with a couple
 of spaces, like 
\family typewriter
" "
\family default
.
 The icon's width and height will be set to title's font ascent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getPressedButtonIndex()
\family default
 Returns the index of the pressed button.
 This index is zero based (the first element has index 0).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This method returns -1 if invoked before the window is closed (or if it
 is closed without any button being pressed).
 To make sure you're retrieving the correct value, consider using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, or invoke this method only after the window is closed (
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, so it also posts the event 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.
 WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 when closed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setTextAlignment(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

align)
\family default
 Sets the alignment of the label that displays the text.
 The argument must be one of the following constants: 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
.
 The default alignment is 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setUnpopDelay(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

unpopDelay)
\family default
 Automatically unpops the message box after the given time in milliseconds.
 You must use this method just before displaying the window (either by 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 or
\family typewriter
 popupNonBlocking()
\family default
).
 This method actually adds a timer to the message box, invoking the 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method when the 
\family typewriter
TimerEvent
\family default
 is triggered.
 Be sure to learn how the timer works to better understand this method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
onEvent(Event
\begin_inset space ~

e)
\family default
 Handles scroll buttons and normal buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setDelayToShowButton(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ms)
\family default
 Calling this method will make the buttons initially hidden and will show
 them after the specified number of milisseconds.
 Here's a sample: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

MessageBox mb = new MessageBox("Novo Tweet!",tweet);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

mb.setTimeToShowButton(7000);

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The method 
\family typewriter
setUnpopDelay()
\family default
 does not affect the regular behavior of the message box – the 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 method will not block the program execution and will still return immediately,
 the 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 method will still block the program execution, and the message box may
 still be dismissed by the user (e.g.
 pressing one of its buttons) before the timer finishes.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
An interesting feature of the message box is that you may create it with
 no buttons, just passing the 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 value for the constructor's argument 
\family typewriter
buttonCaptions
\family default
.
 However, a message box created with no buttons does not provide a default
 way of being dismissed by the user.
 You must dismiss it programatically, by invoking 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
, using 
\family typewriter
setUnpopDelay()
\family default
 or handling events (e.g.
 you may handle pen events to make it unpop after the user touches the screen).

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

dumpToConsole)
\family default
 Immediately displays a message box showing the given throwable name, message,

 Returns the index of the pressed button.
 This index is zero based (the first element has index 0).
 This method returns -1 if invoked before the window is closed (or if it
 is closed without any button being pressed).
 To make sure you're retrieving the correct value, consider using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, or invoke this method only after the window is closed (
\family typewriter
InputBox
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default

 input either by the device's keyboard or by pen events on the virtual keyboard
 on devices with touchscreen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other dialogs, the 
\family typewriter
KeyboardBox
\family default
 constructor does not receive any arguments, and it does not provide any
 methods for its manipulation.
 So how does it work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the keyboard box is popped up, it gets the control of the topmost window
 that currently holds the focus.
 The control is shown at the top of the keyboard box, and any text input
 received is passed to the control as a key event.
 If the virtual keyboard is used, the keyboard box handles the pen event,
 converting it to a key event before passing to the target control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The edit and multi edit controls may use the keyboard box for text input.

Image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image is a rectangular image, which you can draw into or copy to a surface
 (using a 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object).
 They are always 24 bpp, and TotalCross supports only the PNG and JPEG formats
 when running on the TCVM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you may still use GIF and BMP files on your application, because
 these formats are also supported when running on Java, and the TotalCross
 deployer automatically converts those files to 24 bpp PNG files, which
 are then packaged with your application (along with any other required
 resources).
 The deployed PNG may contain transparency information which is correctly
 handled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 objects cannot be directly added to the user interface because they are
 not controls (i.
 e.
 the 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 class does not extend the 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
 class).
 To display an image on the user interface, you may either use the 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object to draw the image on the screen, or use a control that better suits
 your needs, like 
\family typewriter
ImageControl
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 (both described at the user interface section of this document).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some transformation methods return a new instance of this image while others
 apply to the current instance.
 To preserve an image with a single frame, use

 PNG or JPEG are always supported.
 GIF and BMP are supported on JavaSE only.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may change all pixels of the same color by another color with the method
 
\family typewriter
changeColors (int from, int to)
\family default
.
 The current value of the transparent color is not changed.
 Using this routine, you can change the colors to any other you want.
 Note this replaces a single solid color by another solid color.
 If you want to change a gradient or colorize an image, use the 
\family typewriter
applyColor(int color)
\family default
 method instead, which applies the given color RGB values to all pixels
 of this image, preserving the transparent color and alpha channel, if set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The deployer also convert animated GIFs into multi-frame PNGs – which are
 regular PNG files that contains all frames from the original GIF, along
 with the number of frames – to be packaged with the application's tclass

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, you may use the method 
\family typewriter
getFrameCount()
\family default
 to check if the loaded image contains more than one frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you may want to load an actual PNG or JPEG file created in multi-frame
 format to display an animation.
 In this case, the number of frames contained in the file will be unknown
 and 
\family typewriter
getFrameCount()
\family default
 will return 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set the actual number of frames of the image, you must use the method
 
\family typewriter
setFrameCount (int n)
\family default
, which sets the total number of frames of the image by the given one, but
 only if the total image width (including all frames) is divisible by the
 given value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image's frame count cannot be changed if its value is already higher
 than 1.
 In this case, the 
\family typewriter
setFrameCount()

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following methods should be used only on multi-framed images.

 If the given index is negative, the last frame is set as the current frame;
 if it's higher than the number of frames, the first one is set instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

backColor)
\family default
 Returns a scaled instance of the image using the area averaging algorithm.
 Transparent pixels are replaced by 
\family typewriter
backColor
\family default

 Example: 
\begin_inset listings

On device and JavaSE it uses a Catmull-rom resampling.
 The reason is that the Catmull-rom consumes more memory and is also slower
 than the area-average, although the final result is much better.

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Returns a rotated and/or scaled version of this image.
 A new 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 object is returned which will render the image at the specified scale ratio
 and rotation angle.
 After rotation, the empty parts of the rectangular area of the resulting
 image are filled with the fill color.
 If color is -1, then the fill color is the transparent color, or white
 if none.
 The new image will probably have a different size of the original image.
 In multi-framed images, each image is rotated/scaled independently.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\family typewriter
scale
\family default

\family default
, you can use this method.
 If you're going to save it to a 
\family typewriter

saveTo(PDBFile
\begin_inset space ~

\family default
 Writes this image as a 24 bpp PNG file on the currently selected record
 of the given 
\family typewriter
PDBFile
\family default
, using the given name.
 The stored image size is limited to near 64 Kb.
 Note that a stored image size has no relation to its size in pixels.
 For example, a 1300x1200 completely-white PNG file takes 7 Kb of storage
 size but 6 MB of RAM when loaded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The

\begin_layout Itemize
This method finds the exact place where to insert the PNG and puts it there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want to create a PNG to be transfered by a stream to serial or socket

\begin_layout Section
Vector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 class implements a growable array of objects.
 Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer
 index.
 However, the size of a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 can dynamically grow as needed, but it never shrinks.
 If the array never needs to be increased, an array should be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Java you cannot directly access the 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
's internal array, you must use its methods to 
\family typewriter
insert()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
remove()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
retrieve()
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
replace()
\family default
 elements in a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
.
 This way the programmer cannot accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt
 the object's internal state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately this makes 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 iteration a very costly operation, because each iteration requires at least
 one method call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this performance issue, TotalCross' 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 implementation allows public access to its internal array (
\family typewriter
items
\family default
).
 However, to guarantee the Vector's integrity
\emph on
 you must only access it to retrieve (get) or replace (set) elements, and
 never to insert, remove, or resize the buffer
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also use a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 as a stack, whose feature is better explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example showing a vector being used: 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

And to remove:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeElement(Object

 an index one smaller than it had previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

 an index one smaller than it had previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeAllElements()
\family default
 Removes all elements from this

\family default
, reseting its length to 0.
 Note that this method sets all items in this vector to

 it will be nulled.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper

\family default
 Returns the index of the given object, or -1 if the object is not found.
 The array is searched using an

 or the end of the array is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
indexOf(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\family default
 Like the above, but always start the search at the first position (index

Use this approach only when you know the initial number of elements is not

\begin_layout Itemize
The

Vector
\family default
 growth rate is 20% + 1 on device (100% + 1 on Java), so you should avoid
 using the default constructor (the default size is 8) or initializing the

Vector
\family default
 with less than 20 positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 does not shrinks automatically.
 If you make several inserts followed by even more removals, you may end
 up with a huge 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 consuming more memory than it actually needs (i.
 e.
 after the inserts the

IntVector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 is a growable array of integers.
 It's a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 implementation specific for integers, which provides better performance
 and takes less memory than using 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 to hold only integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For efficiency, 
\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 was implemented exactly like 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
: it also allows public access to its internal array (
\family typewriter
items
\family default
), but 
\emph on
you must only access it to retrieve (get) or replace (set) elements, and
 never to insert, remove, or resize the buffer
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 may also be used as a stack (an integer stack in this case).
 It can also be used as a bit array.
 These features are better described below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 has three constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
IntVector()
\family default
 Default constructor, creates an

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
IntVector(int

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
IntVector(int[]
\begin_inset space ~

\family default
 Creates an

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
addElement(int

\family default
, shifting elements with index greater or equal to the specified index to
 have an index one greater than it had previously.
 If 
\family typewriter
index
\family default
 is less than 0 or above the number of elements, the new item is inserted

\end_layout

\end_deeper

And to remove:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
removeElement(int

 an index one smaller than it had previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

startIndex)
\family default
 Returns the index of the given integer, or -1 if the integer is not found.
 The array is searched using an

\family default
 linear search, starting at the given start index, until the integer is
 found or the end of the array is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
indexOf(int
\begin_inset space ~

 In fact its implementation consists of a single method call: 
\family typewriter
indexOf(item, 0)
\family default

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
IntVector

 The new size can't be negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
copyInto(int[]
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
reverse()
\family default
 Reverses the order of the elements in the vector.
 In a vector with

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
push(int

\begin_layout Standard
When we want to deal with bit values, we usually use a boolean array.
 However, each position of a boolean array takes 1 byte of memory instead
 of 1 bit.
 This can be a problem when you need to deal with large arrays of bits.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an alternative, you may use the 
\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 as a real bit array using the provided methods and save a lot of memory.
 But there is a drawback: the internal array does not grow by itself when
 you try to access an index bigger than the array's size.
 So you must make sure the 
\family typewriter
IntVector
\family default
 is large enough to hold the number of bits you want to manipulate, otherwise
 you may get an 
\family typewriter
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sizeInBits)
\family default
 Makes sure the

 You should always call this method before using it as a bit array.
 After that, you can safely use the two methods below.
 This must be done because those methods do not check the bounds of the
 array.

\begin_layout Section
Hashtable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements a hash table, which is a data structure that associates
 keys with values.
 It's primary operation is a lookup: given a key, finds the corresponding
 value.
 It works by transforming the key into a hash using the method 
\family typewriter
hashCode()
\family default
 (inherited from 
\family typewriter
Object
\family default
), which is then used as an index for the hash table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hash tables should be used when the number of search operations greatly
 supersedes the number of insertions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value, optionally, you
 can provide your own hash code instead of providing a key from which the
 hash code will be calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An instance of 
\family typewriter
Hashtable
\family default
 has two parameters that affect its efficiency: its 
\emph on
capacity
\emph default
 and its 
\emph on
load factor
\emph default
.
 The load factor should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
 When the number of entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the
 load factor and the current capacity, the capacity is increased by calling
 the 
\family typewriter
rehash()
\family default
 method.
 Larger load factors use memory more efficiently, at the expense of larger
 expected time per lookup.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If many entries are to be made into a hash table, creating it with a sufficientl
y large capacity may allow the entries to be inserted more efficiently than
 letting it perform automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Hashtable
\family default
 has two public fields:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
collisions
\family default
 Computes the number of collisions for a set of inserts.
 You must zero this each time you want to compute it.
 Keep in mind that the lower collisions is better, but don't waste too much
 memory if it's too high.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
allowDuplicateKeys
\family default
 Setting this to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 will allow the hashtable to have more than one key with the same value.
 In this case, the methods will always return the first matching key.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Hashtable

 has four constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

initialCapacity)
\family default
 Creates an empty hash table with the specified initial capacity and default
 load factor of

 If 
\family typewriter
initialCapacity
\family default
 is zero, it is changed to 5.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The argument 
\family typewriter

\family default
's value should be the final number of entries in the hash table to avoid

loadFactor)
\family default
 Creates a new, 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

empty hashtable with the specified initial capacity and the specified load
 factor, which must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
 If 
\family typewriter
initialCapacity
\family default
 is zero, it is changed to 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Hashtable(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

res)
\family default
 Creates a new hash table parsing the elements from the given string.
 The string must be in the form: 
\family typewriter
key = value
\family default
, split in lines (
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
).
 This aids the task of creating resource bundles to add localization to
 your application.
 For example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

// save these two lines in a file named EN.txt:  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Message = Message  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

TestMsg = This is a test  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Exit = Exit  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

// save these other two in a file named PT.txt:  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Message = Mensagem 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

TestMsg = Isso e um teste 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Exit = Sair 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The TotalCross deployer will include the two files referenced below in the
 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file.
 Now, when your program starts, you can do:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String txt = idiom == EN? "EN.txt" : "PT.txt";
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

byte[] b = Vm.getFile(txt);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Hashtable res = new Hashtable(new String(b,0,b.length));
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

new MessageBox(res.get("Message"), res.get("TestMsg"), new String[]{res.get("Exit")
}).popupNonBlocking();
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that the keys are case sensitive, and that all strings are trimmed.

 The initial capacity must be the number of elements you think the hash
 table will end with.
 The hash table will grow if necessary, but using a number near or above

 To increase safeness, set 
\family typewriter
allowDuplicateKeys
\family default

Logger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Logger
\family default
 object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component.
 Loggers are usually named using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace.
 Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should usually be based
 on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as 
\family typewriter
totalcross.net
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
.
 In addition it is possible to retrieve one global "anonymous" logger that
 can be used in the whole system.
 A logger can be created or retrieved (if it already exists) by 
\family typewriter
getLogger()
\family default
.
 To dispose a logger after using it, just call 
\family typewriter
dispose()
\family default
 and it will be permanently discarded (it will be closed and it won't be
 possible to use it anymore).
 To log a message, you may call the 
\family typewriter
log()
\family default
 method or any of the other convenience methods (
\family typewriter
info()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
severe()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
entering()
\family default
, etc).
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring WARNING0

\family typewriter
FINEST
\family default
 Indicates a highly detailed tracing message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring WARNING0

\family typewriter
WARNING
\family default
 Message level indicating a potential problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring WARNING0

\family typewriter

BigDecimal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers.
 A 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 consists of an arbitrary precision integer unscaled value and a 32-bit
 integer scale.
 If zero or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of
 the decimal point.
 If negative, the unscaled value of the number is multiplied by ten to the
 power of the negation of the scale.
 The value of the number represented by the 
\family typewriter

 is therefore

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 class provides operations for arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding,
 comparison, hashing, and format conversion.
 The 
\family typewriter
toString()
\family default
 method provides a canonical representation of a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 class gives its user complete control over rounding behavior.
 If no rounding mode is specified and the exact result cannot be represented,
 an exception is thrown; otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a
 chosen precision and rounding mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the same numerical value can have different representations (with
 different scales), the rules of arithmetic and rounding must specify both
 the numerical result and the scale used in the result's representation.
 In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine how operations
 return results with a limited number of digits when the exact result has
 more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the case of division) than the
 number of digits returned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all arithmetic operators, the operation is carried out as though an
 exact intermediate result were first calculated and then rounded to the
 number of digits specified by the precision setting (if necessary), using
 the selected rounding mode.
 If the exact result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact
 result are discarded.
 When rounding increases the magnitude of the returned result, it is possible
 for a new digit position to be created by a carry propagating to a leading
 "9" digit.
 For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up would
 be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as 100×10
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In such cases, the new "1" is the leading digit position of the returned
 result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a preferred
 scale for representing a result.
 The preferred scale for each operation is listed in the table below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact arithmetic
 results; except that an exact divide may have to use a larger scale since
 the exact result may have more digits.
 For example, 1/32 is 0.03125.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate result is the
 preferred scale for that operation.
 If the exact numerical result cannot be represented in precision digits,
 rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale of the result
 is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result to the least scale
 which can represent the precision digits actually returned.
 If the exact result can be represented with at most precision digits, the
 representation of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale
 is returned.
 In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be represented in
 fewer than precision digits by removing trailing zeros and decreasing the
 scale.
 For example, rounding to three digits using the floor rounding mode, 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2 
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

but 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3
\family default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in scale will equal
 the number of digit positions of the exact result which are discarded.
 If the rounding causes a carry propagation to create a new high-order digit
 position, an additional digit of the result is discarded than when no new
 digit position is created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
 For example, the result of the 
\family typewriter
pow()
\family default
 method using the specified algorithm can occasionally differ from the rounded
 mathematical result by more than one unit in the last place, one ulp.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale of a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
: scaling/rounding operations and decimal point motion operations.
 Scaling/rounding operations (
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

setScale()
\family default
) return a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal to that of the operand,
 but whose scale or precision is the specified value; that is, they increase
 or decrease the precision of the stored number with minimal effect on its
 value.
 Decimal point motion operations (
\family typewriter
movePointLeft()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
movePointRight()
\family default
) return a 
\family typewriter
BigDecimal
\family default
 created from the operand by moving the decimal point a specified distance
 in the specified direction.

Therefore, the numbers 4.25, 4.5, and 4.75 are represented in binary like this,
 respectively: 100,01, 100,10, and 100,11.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is very poor to represent decimals.
 Trying to represent 0.3 in binary results in an infinite binary number,
 because 0.3 = 0.25 + 0.03125 + 0.009765635...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To bypass the problem, the calculations are done with many decimal digits
 and then the result is rounded.
 This explains why 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 calculations are not precise.
 Some processors use 50 bits, which is good enough for many applications.
 However, it is not an infinite number of bits, which is needed to represent
 some numbers, such as 0.3.

BigInteger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class represents arbitrary-precision integers.
 All operations behave as if 
\family typewriter
BigIntegers
\family default
 were represented in two's-complement notation (like Java's primitive integer
 types).
 
\family typewriter
BigInteger
\family default
 provides analogues to all of Java's primitive integer operators.
 Additionally, 
\family typewriter
BigInteger
\family default
 provides operations for modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality
 testing, prime generation, bit manipulation, and a few other miscellaneous
 operations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's integer
 arithmetic operators, as defined in The Java Language Specification.
 For example, division by zero throws an
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ArithmeticException
\family default
, and division of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.
 All of the details in the specification concerning overflow are ignored,
 as 
\family typewriter
BigIntegers
\family default
 are made as large as necessary to accommodate the results of an operation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators to
 allow for negative shift distances.
 A right-shift with a negative shift distance results in a left shift, and
 vice-versa.
 The unsigned right shift operator (>>>) is omitted, as this operation makes
 little sense in combination with the "infinite word size" abstraction provided
 by this class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's bitwise
 integer operators.
 The binary operators (and, or, xor) implicitly perform sign extension on
 the shorter of the two operands prior to performing the operation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to those
 performed by Java's relational and equality operators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
 exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.
 These methods always return a non-negative result, between 0 and (modulus
 - 1), inclusive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement representation
 of their operand.
 If necessary, the operand is sign-extended so that it contains the designated
 bit.
 None of the single-bit operations can produce a 
\family typewriter
BigInteger
\family default
 with a different sign from the 
\family typewriter
BigInteger
\family default
 being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the "infinite
 word size" abstraction provided by this class ensures that there are infinitely
 many "virtual sign bits" preceding each

\begin_layout Standard
The

Time
\family default
 class stores a specific a date and time.
 The year must have 4 digits and the hour is numbered in 24-hour notation,
 which is the international standard notation of time, and may also be referred
 as military time or astronomical time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For performance reasons, the 
\family typewriter
Time
\family default
 fields have public access.
 So you can directly access the field day to get or set its value, instead
 of calling a method.
 However, that makes the 
\family typewriter
Time
\family default
 objects unsafe because the fields' values are not checked when they are
 set, and may not be within the field valid range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the fields can be set without any kind of validation, it would be
 pointless to add validation to the other methods, therefore, 
\emph on
the Time fields' values are never validated by any method or constructor
\emph default
.
 So you must know and always respect the fields' range, and never set a
 field with a variable without first checking if the value is withing range
 (for instance, let the user type the hour in an edit and simply convert
 it to 
\family typewriter

\family default
 and set the 
\family typewriter
hour
\family default
 field, without checking if its value is between 0 and 23).

\begin_layout Section
CharacterConvert
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is used to correctly handle international character conversions.
 The default character scheme converter is the 8859-1 (ISO Latin 1).
 If you want to use a different one, you must extend this class, implementing
 the 
\family typewriter
bytes2chars()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
chars2bytes()
\family default
 methods, and then assign the public member of 
\family typewriter
Convert.charConverter
\family default
 to use your class instead of this default one.
 You can also use the method 
\family typewriter
Convert.setDefaultConverter()
\family default
 to change it, passing, as parameter, the prefix of your 
\family typewriter
CharacterConverter
\family default
 class (better look at the implementation to know what to pass on).
 For example, if you created a class named 
\family typewriter
Iso88592CharacterConverter
\family default
, call 
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Convert.setDefaultConverter("Iso88592");

Convert
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Convert
\family default
 basically provides methods that allows object and basic type conversion.
 Furthermore, it also provides handy methods for common operations that
 should be used for a better performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is final and cannot be instantiated – its methods and fields
 are static.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give you a better view of this class, its documentation was split into
 sub-sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Changing the default character converter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field 
\family typewriter
charConverter
\family default
 keeps a reference to a character converter that will be used by default.
 You may change it by setting another character converter of your choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also use the method 
\family typewriter
setDefaultConverter(String name)
\family default
, which searches for a character converter by its name, and makes it the
 default by changing the 
\family typewriter
charConverter
\family default
 field.
 Use like 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Convert.setDefaultConverter("UTF8");
\end_layout

\end_inset

to change all bytes_to_char and char_to_bytes operations to use UTF8 instead.
 Issuing 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Convert.setDefaultConverter("");
\end_layout

\end_inset

sets back the default encoder.
 The method returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if the given encoder was found; 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, otherwise.
 If not found, the encoder is reseted to the default one (ISO 8859-1).

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this part is to teach you how to use the classes in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 package.
 The classes that will be covered in this tutorial are outlined below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Stream
\family default
: is the main class of all classes inside the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 package.
 It can be viewed as a generic stream where data can flow in and out of
 the device.
 All classes inside package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 extend this class, and most classes receive a 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Stream
\family default
 in their constructor parameter.
 This allows you to combine different streams to meet your needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.DataStream
\family default
 (and 
\family typewriter
DataStreamLE
\family default
): used to read/write primitive types and strings in Big Endian (default)
 or Little Endian format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.BufferedStream
\family default
: offers a faster way to read and write data from streams in a buffered
 manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.ByteArrayStream
\family default
: a resizable buffer that can be used to feed data to a stream or to store
 data coming from a stream.
 It can be used to emulate a virtual stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.CompressedByteArrayStream
\family default
: creates a compressed byte array stream, saving memory when reading and
 writting huge amount of data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.RandomAccessStream
\family default
: represents a stream that behaves like a large array of bytes and may be
 randomly accessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.CRC32Stream
\family default
: computes CRC32 data checksum of a stream.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Connector
\family default
: used to open socket connections over CRADLE, WIFI, MDS, GPRS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.StreamConnectionNotifier
\family default
: base class for connection notifiers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.PortConnector
\family default
: used to send and receive bytes via Serial Cradle, USB, IrComm, and Bluetooth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.File
\family default
: used to create files and manage directories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.LineReader
\family default
: used to read lines ending with 
\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\backslash
n
\family default
 (enter/linefeed) or 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 (linefeed) from a stream.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.TokenReader
\family default
: Used to read an array of tokens in a line ending with 
\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\backslash
n
\family default
 (enter/linefeed) from a stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.gps.GPS 
\family default
retrieves GPS coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.RadioDevice
\family default
 provides access to the device's radios and information about their status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classes related to PDB files (
\family typewriter
PDBFile
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ObjectPDBFile
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PDBStream
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ResizeRecord
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RemotePDBFile
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
RemotePDBRecord
\family default
) are ommited because they are inefficient on all platforms.
 Unless you use a legacy TotalCross program, don't use PDB files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Stream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 is an abstract class that serves as the base class for all classes that
 handles I/O operations.
 It defines the interface and the basic behavior that all its subclasses
 must implement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 Closes this stream, releasing any resources associated to it.
 Once closed a connection is no longer valid.

\family typewriter
buf
\family default
, beginning from the position 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
.
 Returns the number of bytes actually written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three methods may throw an 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
, which usually means that something out of our control went wrong, preventing
 the method to be executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 subclasses usually throw more exceptions that extends 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
 to denote more specific problems and allow you to properly handle the situation
, like 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Streams
\family default
 subclasses can be divided into two main groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classes that actually perform I/O operations, like 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classes that wrap a stream, providing features or operations that can be
 applied to any other stream, like 
\family typewriter
DataStream
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BufferedStream
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll first look into this last group, which provides easier and more efficient
 ways of reading and writing data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should always chech the return of the methods to see if the written
 or read number of bytes are the expected one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more details, check out 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Stream
\family default
 JavaDoc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
DataStream/DataStreamLE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
DataStream
\family default
 is a wrapper that you can place around any stream such as a 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
ByteArrayStream
\family default
, which allows you to read and write TotalCross' primitive data types and
 objects, like 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
s, 
\family typewriter
long
\family default
s, 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
s, and 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
s, in a simple and standard way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although TotalCross internally uses the little endian format, the 
\family typewriter
DataStream
\family default
 class uses the big endian format - the standard Java format.
 To read and write using the little endian format, you must use the 
\family typewriter
DataStreamLE
\family default
 class instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a sample:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

PortConnector port = new PortConnector(9600, 0);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

DataStream ds = new DataStream(port);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ds.writeString("Hello");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int status = ds.readUnsignedByte();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (status == 1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ds.writeString("Pi");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	ds.writeDouble(3.14);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

port.close();   
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

ByteArrayStream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ByteArrayStream
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 that has an internal growable byte array, and it is commonly used as a
 buffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In I/O operations, usually it's faster and/or less resource consuming to
 send larger chunks of data at once, instead of sending several small chunks
 of data.
 You may use a 
\family typewriter
ByteArrayStream
\family default
 as a buffer and wait until it reaches a minimum size performing any actual
 I/O operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Socket s = new Socket(host, 8080); // connect to our host
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

bas.readFully(s, 10, 0); /* reads from the given stream (our socket) until

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This difference is easily noticeable when dealing with external connections,
 like socket or port connector, but don't forget their operations usually
 have a time limit (timeout), that must be adjusted according to your connection
 speed and the amount of data you want to be able to read or write in a
 single I/O operation.
 Using a low timeout to send or receive large amounts of data may cause
 problems.

reuse()
\family default
 Shifts the bytes starting at the current position to the first position
 of the buffer – this way you may reuse the buffer without exceeding the
 buffer limits, which would make the buffer grow and consume more memory.
 This method also returns the number of bytes shifted, which may be used
 to move the cursor to the end of it and reuse the buffer without overwriting
 the shifted bytes.

 The argument

 This is specially useful for streams that handle external connections,
 like

Be careful when using this method with streams like file.
 It may read the whole file at once, resulting in a great loss of performance
 and resources (the buffer may be resized several times).
 In the worst scenario, the device will run out of memory and the application
 will be halted.
 In this case, you should check the size of the stream before using 
\family typewriter
readFully()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The argument 
\family typewriter
bufSize
\family default
 specifies a minimum size for the internal buffer – therefore, if its value
 is equal or lower than the size of the buffer, it is not resized (i.e.
 you cannot use it to shrink the buffer).
 Otherwise, the buffer will be resized to match the given value.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Please notice, the buffer will still grow if necessary, regardless of the
 
\family typewriter
bufSize
\family default
 value.
 So you cannot use it to limit the amount of data read, and you may specify
 a value 0 or lower if you do not wish to define a minimum size – this will
 not prevent its automatic resize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The byte array stream is reseted at the beginning of 
\family typewriter
readFully()
\family default
, so you can't use it in a loop as a buffer for a stream, you must use the
 argument 
\family typewriter
retryCount
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Calling the method reset before 
\family typewriter

 is pointless, since this is already done by

readFully()

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After 
\family typewriter
readFully()
\family default
 finishes reading from the internal buffer, it marks the current cursor
 position and sets the cursor to the first position of the array, so you
 may read from the buffer without going past the number of bytes actually
 available for reading.

\begin_layout Standard
Creates a

CompressedByteArrayStream
\family default
, saving memory when reading and writting huge amount of data.
 Arrays of 16000 bytes will be created and each byte array will be compressed
 once filled and will be automatically decompressed on read.
 This saves space but adds a slowdown to the process.
 It is useful when transferring FTP files to/from the server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class cannot be used for output AND input, but only for output OR input,
 in an absolutely sequential mode (the

 To change the mode, use the 
\family typewriter
setMode(READ_MODE
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter

\family default
 method.
 No check is made to see if you're in the right mode, but your program will
 probably crash if you do it in the wrong one.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Archive and directory methods – May be used with any file, regardless of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Directory only methods – Can only be used with directories.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Behavior depends on the file type – May be used with any file, but the method

isDir()
\family default
 Returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if and only if the file exists and is a directory, returning 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, otherwise.
 To check if a file is an archive, you must test if the file is not a directory
 and if the file exists.
 Obviously this method should only be used in mode 
\family typewriter
DONT_OPEN
\family default
, since it will always return 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 in any other mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getPath()
\family default
 Returns the file's path passed in the constructor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\family default
 object that references this file's parent directory, or 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 if this file does not have a parent directory (it's the root directory).
 The new file object is created in 
\family typewriter
DONT_OPEN
\family default
 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
rename(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

path)
\family default
 Renames the file with the given path.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This operation closes the 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object, so you should not perform any operations after a rename.
 You must give the full directory specification for the file to keep compatibili
ty between all platforms.
 The file is automatically closed prior to renaming.
 After this operation, the 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object is invalid.
 It cannot be used in 
\family typewriter
READ_ONLY
\family default
 mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
delete()
\family default
 Removes the file from the file system.
 If the file is a directory, it must be empty, otherwise an 
\family typewriter

\family default
 will be thrown.
 If the file does not exist, a
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
 is thrown.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This operation closes the file object, so you should not perform any operations
 after a delete.
 The file could have been opened in any of the available modes, except for
 
\family typewriter
READ_ONLY
\family default
.
 Example: 
\begin_inset listings

 calling 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 twice, or 
\family typewriter
rename()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
) results in an 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This operation closes the 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object, so you should not perform any operations after a close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
isEmpty()
\family default
 If the object is a file, returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if the file has 0 bytes.
 If it is a folder, returns

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
createDir()
\family default
 Creates the directory named by this path, including any necessary but nonexiste
nt parent directories.
 It throws an 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
 if the file was closed, if it was open in anything else than 
\family typewriter
DONT_OPEN
\family default
, if the directory already exists, or if the directories could not be created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
deleteDir()
\family default
 Deletes a directory and all its subdirectories and files.
 If you have problems trying to recreate the directory, be sure to call
 
\family typewriter

\family default
 after calling this method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
listFiles()
\family default
 Returns an array of strings denoting the files in this directory.
 The strings returned are the names of the files and directories contained
 within this directory.
 Paths are suffixed by a slash.
 If the folder is empty, the method returns an empty array whereas if the
 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object is not a directory,

listFiles(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

dir)
\family default
 Static method that returns a recursive list of all files inside the given
 directory (including it).
 The array is sorted upon return.
 If the folder is empty, the method returns an empty array whereas if the
 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object is not a directory, 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
writeBytes(byte[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

b,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

off,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

len)
\family default
 Attempts to write 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 Returns the number of bytes actually written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
flush()
\family default
 Flushes the stream, forcing any buffered bytes to be written on the file.
 This causes any pending data to be written to disk.
 Calling this method too much may decrease the performance.
 It has no effect on Java.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setPos(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

pos)
\family default
 Moves the file pointer for read and write operations to the given position.
 The position passed is an absolute position, in bytes, from the beginning
 of the file.
 To set the position to just after the end of the file, you can call: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

file.setPos(file.getSize()); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note: if you plan to change the file size using 
\family typewriter
setPos()
\family default
, you must write something on the new size to effectively change the size.
 For example, on some devices if you call 
\family typewriter
setPos()
\family default
 and then read (assuming that the new position is past the end of the file,
 the read method will fail.
 Here's a code that will change the size for sure: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

private static byte[] zeros = new byte[4096];
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public void setSize(int newSize)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	int size = f.getSize();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	f.setPos(newSize - 1); // note: setPos(1) makes the file 2 bytes long (0,
 1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	f.setPos(size);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	for (int dif = newSize - size, n = 0; dif > 0; dif -= n)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		n = f.writeBytes(zeros, 0, dif > zeros.length ? zeros.length : dif);
\end_layout

The modifiers you want to set (mod) must be given in DECIMAL, or -1 to just
 return the current ones.
 It returns the modifiers that were set before you called this method (or
 the current modifiers, if -1 is being passed).
 Some platforms may return more than 3 digits, indicating extra attributes
 (for example, if it's a file or a directory).

readAndClose()
\family default
 Reads the entire file into a byte array and closes itself.
 A handy method that can be used like this: 
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

byte[] bytes = new File(...,File.READ_ONLY).readAndClose();
\end_layout

\end_inset

The only drawback is that this method consumes lots of memory if the file
 is big; use it carefully.

\begin_layout Standard
As shown above, you may use the methods 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to retrieve or change the attributes of an archive (these operations are
 not supported for directories) with the following constants:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ATTR_ARCHIVE
\family default
 Often used to mark an archive for backup or removal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ATTR_HIDDEN 
\family default
Hidden files are usually not listed on the file system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ATTR_READ_ONLY
\family default
 Archives marked as read only cannot be opened with write access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ATTR_SYSTEM
\family default
 Archives marked as system are normally used only by the OS, and should
 not be changed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These values are platform independent, and can be 
\family typewriter

 However, these attributes are not supported by all platforms, and although
 you are not required to write platform specific code, you must be aware
 that you should not rely on certain attributes when writing cross-platform
 applications.

LineReader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Class used to read lines ending with 
\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\backslash
n
\family default
 (enter/linefeed) or 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
 (linefeed) from a stream.
 Consecutive newlines are skipped.
 This class does not work well with multi-byte characters when the second
 byte contains the delimiter or enter/linefeed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a sample: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

LineReader reader = new LineReader(new File("text.txt",File.READ_WRITE));
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String line; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	// ...
 do whatever you want with the line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that this class already uses a buffer for faster detection of the newline.
 Don't use 
\family typewriter
LineReader
\family default
 with a 
\family typewriter
BufferedStream
\family default
, it's nonsense and it will throw a warning on the desktop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
TokenReader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a 
\family typewriter
LineReader
\family default
 subclass used to read an array of tokens in a line ending with 
\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\backslash
n
\family default
 (enter/linefeed) from a stream.
 Consecutive newlines are skipped.
 This class does not work well with multi-byte characters when the second
 byte contains the delimiter or enter/linefeed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usual way to parse a CSV file is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

LineReader reader = new LineReader(new File("text.txt",File.READ_WRITE));
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String line;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String[] tokens;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	tokens = Convert.tokenizeString(line, "
\backslash
n,");   
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this class takes less memory, because the line is read in tokens.
 For example, suppose a line contains 200 chars, and splitting them contains
 10 tokens of 20 chars each.
 Using the first approach (
\family typewriter
readline()
\family default
/
\family typewriter
tokenizeString()
\family default
), the 
\family typewriter
readline()
\family default
 will create a string with 200 chars, then that string will be tokenized
 into 10 smaller strings of 20 chars each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this class, it will read the 10 tokens of 20 chars each directly,
 no longer having to create the temporary string of 200 chars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The delimiter can be any character except for 
\family typewriter

\backslash
r
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
.
 Note that two consecutive delimiters are considered a single token.
 So 
\family typewriter
;a;;
\family default
 is returned as 
\family typewriter
{"","a","",""}
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a sample that parses the input from a file: 
\begin_inset listings

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

String[] tokens;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

while ((tokens = reader.readTokens()) != null)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   // ...
 do whatever you want with the tokens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

GPS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
GPS
\family default
 is a class that retrieves GPS coordinates read from Android, WP8, and iOS
 native API.
 This class only retrieves data updating the internal fields.
 If you want to display that data, you may use the 
\family typewriter
GPSView
\family default
 class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the GPS fails connecting to the satellites, and the phone has signal,
 you can use the cell tower location as a rough location.
 The precision varies between 50m to 3km, depending on the phone location.
 In this case, you can get the latitude and longitude using 
\family typewriter
CellInfo.toCoordinates()
\family default
 on Android and Windows 32.
 This won't work on other platforms.
 Don't forget to turn on the GPS, going to somewhere similar to Settings
 / Security & Location / Enable GPS satellites.
 You won't be able to use if if it's off in the settings.

COMPRESSION

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section covers the usage of classes that handle data compression, inflating
 compressed data or deflating uncompressed data using streams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
CompressedStream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abstract class used as the basis for compression filters, such as 
\family typewriter
ZLibStream
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
GZipStream
\family default
.
 It is the base class for stream filters that perform data compression and
 decompression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instances of subclasses of 
\family typewriter
CompressedStream
\family default
 cannot be used for both read and write operations.
 At the object creation, you MUST choose if the new object is going to be
 used either for reading or writing compressed data, by passing one of the
 following constants to the class constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
DEFLATE
\family default
 Used to create a stream for data compression.
 In this mode, you may ONLY use write operations, that is, you may NOT use
 the method 
\family typewriter
readBytes()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
INFLATE
\family default
 Used to create a stream for data decompression.
 In this mode, you may ONLY use read operations, that is, you may NOT use
 the method 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Subclasses of 
\family typewriter
CompressedStream
\family default
 that implements algorithms with different levels of compression, should
 always use a constant default value for data compression.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that closing a compressed stream (using its 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 method) DOES NOT affect the underlying stream (the stream passed to the
 constructor).
 To also close the underlying stream, you must call its own 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 method after closing the compressed stream.

Adler32 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computes an Adler-32 checksum for a stream of data.
 An Adler-32 checksum is not as reliable as a CRC32 checksum, but a lot
 faster to compute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specification for Adler-32 may be found in RFC 1950 (ZLIB Compressed
 Data Format Specification version 3.3).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that document: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum) This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed
 data (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32 algorithm.
 This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement of the Fletcher algorithm,
 used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073 standard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is the sum of all bytes, 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
 is the sum of all 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 values.
 Both sums are done modulo 65521.
 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is initialized to 1, 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
 to zero.
 The Adler-32 checksum is stored as 
\family typewriter
s2*65536 + s1
\family default
 in most-significant-byte first (network) order." 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"8.2.
 The Adler-32 algorithm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet still
 provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552 bytes,
 so the modulo operation time is negligible.
 If the bytes are 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
b
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c
\family default
, the second sum is 
\family typewriter
3a + 2b + c + 3
\family default
, and so is position and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is
 just a checksum.
 That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible large class of two-byte
 errors that leave the check unchanged (the Fletcher checksum uses 255,
 which is not prime and which also makes the Fletcher check insensitive
 to single byte changes 
\family typewriter
0 <-> 255
\family default
) .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length of the sequence
 part of 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
, so that the length does not have to be checked separately (any sequence
 of zeroes has a Fletcher checksum of zero)."

Socket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 class allows you to open TCP/IP connections from your device.
 To be able to establish a connection with a particular server, both the
 server and the device must be connected to a common network (e.g.
 a local network that connects your computers and devices, or the Internet).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 object denotes a client-server connection over a network using the TCP/IP
 protocol, where the device acts as a client, which connects to a specific
 server port.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 class does not provide many methods besides the ones inherited from 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
.
 After creating a socket, you'll usually just perform read and write operations,
 closing the socket after you're done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, streams that handle remote connections are more likely to fail
 due to hardware and communication problems, so we shouldn't handle socket
 operations the same way we do with file operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross, socket's read and write operations are blocking with a timeout
 – that means that socket methods will block the thread until the operation
 is completed, or the timeout for the operation is reached.
 If the operation is completed, the method returns immediately, regardless
 of the amount of time left.
 Otherwise, the method will just return the amount of data processed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to notice that no exception is thrown if the method times
 out.
 This is just a way to prevent your thread from being blocked indefinitely
 because of communication problems.
 You may just keep executing the same method until it finishes processing
 all the data.

\begin_layout Standard
Usually you should not worry about the read and write timeouts.
 The default values will be fine in most cases.
 However, you may increase the timeout value if you experience problems
 with slow connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing the timeout value is usually a bad idea.
 If your device has a high speed connection, the read and write methods
 should also be fast and return before the timeout is reached.
 However, reducing the timeout value won't give you any benefit, and may
 even decrease your program performance.

\begin_layout Standard
Except for the method 
\family typewriter
readLine()
\family default
, the methods above are just available for convenience and may be replaced
 by read/write calls inherited from

 This has a cost however - using these methods increases the number of method
 calls for each read/write operation by one (they actually just call the
 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 methods).
 If your application makes heavy use of sockets, you may avoid using these
 methods to improve its performance.

ServerSocket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements server sockets.
 A server socket waits for requests to come in over the network.
 It may then accept the incoming TCP/IP connection and perform some operation
 based on that request, possibly returning a result to the requester.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ServerSocket
\family default
 constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ServerSocket(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

port)
\family default
 Attempts to open a server socket at the specified port number.
 By default, the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed is 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_BACKLOG
\family default
 and the default timeout for accept is 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_SOTIMEOUT
\family default
, and the server is not bound to any specific local address.
 The port number must be between 0 and 65535.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating a server socket, you may use the method 
\family typewriter
accept()
\family default
 to wait for incoming connections.
 This method blocks the thread for the amount of time specified by the timeout
 value passed to the constructor, returning a 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 value when the timeout is over, or until a connection request is received
 and accepted, returning a socket instance representing the new connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The returned object is always a valid 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 instance, that may be used to transfer data between this server and the
 client that requested the connection, and that should be closed when no
 longer needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should never use blocking operations on threads handling events and/or
 the graphical interface, otherwise the user won't be able to interact with
 the application.
 Take a look at the source code of the sample ServerSocketTest.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a new 
\family typewriter
SOAP
\family default
 instance, you must use the following constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
SOAP(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mtd,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

String
\begin_inset space ~

uri)
\family default
 Creates a new SOAP request where 
\family typewriter
mtd
\family default
 specifies the remote method to be executed, and 
\family typewriter
uri
\family default
, the address of the Web Service.
 The default namespace will be used, along with an open timeout of 25 seconds,
 and a read and write timeout of 60 seconds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating a new 
\family typewriter
SOAP
\family default
 object, you may set some of its following instance fields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
wasCompressionUsed
\family default
 A flag that indicates if the SOAP connection was using either GZip or ZLib.
 This is a ready-only flag, set during the 
\family typewriter
execute()
\family default
 method, and changing its value has no effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
alternativeReturnTag
\family default
 By default, the XML parser used by SOAP will recognize as an answer tag
 any tags whose name ends with “result” or “return” (ignoring the case).
 This field, if set, specifies an alternative answer tag name, recognizing
 any XML element that ends with the specified value as an answer tag.

 It's just a new value with higher priority over the default ones.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family default
 String that identifies the service's namespace.
 Its default value is:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

 Specifies the connection open timeout value in milliseconds.
 Its default value is defined by the constant 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_OPEN_TIMEOUT
\family default
 (25 s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
readTimeout
\family default
 Specifies the connection read timeout value in milliseconds.
 Its default value is defined by the constant 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_READ_TIMEOUT
\family default
 (60 s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
writeTimeout
\family default
 Specifies the connection write timeout value in milliseconds.
 Its default value is defined by the constant 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_WRITE_TIMEOUT
\family default
 (60 s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mtd
\family default
 Stores the name of the remote method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You may change both the 
\family typewriter

\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
uri
\family default
 values before executing the request.
 Although this seems to be pointless, because these values are passed to
 the constructor.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the remote method expects any arguments, you must set them using the
 
\family typewriter
setParam()
\family default
 method.
 However, there are several versions of this method to cover different argument
 types.
 Listing all of them would be pointless, so we'll define a generic type
 that we'll refer as 
\family typewriter
<type>
\family default
, and may be one of the of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
int
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
boolean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
double
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
String
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, whenever a SOAP method is described like 
\family typewriter
setParam(<type> param)
\family default
, you can safely assume there are four versions of this method, one for
 each type listed above.
 Other type of parameters can be passed using similar methods.
 Unicode characters are not accepted because the default header uses UTF-8.

The only thing left to do now is to execute the request and check the service's
 answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
execute()
\family default
 This method simply executes the prepared SOAP request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getAnswer()
\family default
 To retrieve the method's answer, you must call this method after 
\family typewriter
execute()
\family default
.
 The return type of this method is 
\family typewriter
Object
\family default
, but it may return only three different values (the values may be escaped;
 use 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.html.EscapeHtml.unescape()
\family default
 to convert it back).
 The remote method return type is known, so you may just typecast the

\family default
 returned by 
\family typewriter
getAnswer()
\family default

\family default
 When the remote method has no return value or the execution failed for
 any reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 When the remote method returns a single value.
 If the expected value is not

\begin_layout Standard
Basically, TLS allows secured and authenticated communication between two
 components generally so-called client & server.
 It relies on X509 certificates, their associated private keys to encrypt
 and associated public keys to decrypt exchanged data.
 The certificates could be self signed or signed by an Authority known as
 CA (Certification Authority) that have to be trusted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insofar the subject of SSL based security is well documented on the web,
 we won't go further in the TLS description and invite people interrested

 for more details).
 First we will have to create our own CA, that could be replaced by any
 "well known" commercial CA such as Verisign, Thawte, etc, if you have the
 need for a public authority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use openssl (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first entry is the private key password.
 The private key is used to sign other certificates to assert they are authentic.
 The private key is protected by a password as a further security because
 the CA private key is a main secret that have to be protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next you will have to fill in X500 attributes describing the certificate
 subject.
 In our case, we enter information describing the SuperWaba CA (Certification
 Authority).
 Any agent trusting this CA, will authenticate certificates that have been
 signed by it through the CA embedded public key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have two files, 
\family typewriter
cakey.pem
\family default
 containing an encrypted version of the CA private key protected by a password
 and 
\family typewriter
cacert.pem
\family default
 containing an X509 certificate embedding the CA public key that could be
 redistributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you have to create a text file named 
\family typewriter
ca.srl
\family default
 with the content "00" for certicate signing counting, just execute the
 following command :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ echo “00” > ca.srl
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Create a client or server X509 certificate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, you have to generate a new private key.
 SSL supports unencrypted and aes128/256 encrypted private keys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl genrsa -aes128 -out mykey.pem 512
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may replace 
\family typewriter
-aes128
\family default
 by 
\family typewriter
-aes256
\family default
 for a stronger cipher, or remove 
\family typewriter
-aes128
\family default
 at all to generate a private key that is not encrypted.
 When you ask for an encrypted key, you have to enter a password used in
 the ciphering.
 The last option represents the key size in bits, values between 512 and
 4096 bits for a higher security are accepted, but always keep in mind that
 higher security implies longer processing times especially critical on
 embedded devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next you have to generate a certificate request.
 This file could be transmitted to one of the commercial CA companies for
 signing or could be signed by our previously created private CA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl req -new -out my.req -key mykey.pem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add 
\family typewriter
-x509
\family default
 if you want to generate a self signed certificate if you don't want to
 use a CA at all (in this case, you may name the file 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
 rather than 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
).
 Insofar, the 
\family typewriter
out
\family default
 file will contain a finalized self-signed certificate rather than a certificate
 request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enter all information describing your client or your server component.
 The certificate request will be stored in the file 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will sign the certificate with the CA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl x509 -CA cacert.pem -CAkey cakey.pem -CAserial ca.srl -req -in
 my.req -out mycert.pem -days 1460
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
cacert.pem
\family default
 is the CA certificate, 
\family typewriter
cakey.pem
\family default
 its above created PEM encrypted private key, 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
 is the certificate request file generated previously and 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
 is the resulting signed certificate that can be used for authentication
 and encryption during 1460 days (4 years).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Principle of an X509 authentication/encryption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
X509 authentication/encryption is based on public/private key encryption
 that have a great characteristic.
 Indeed, the data ciphered by either key could only be deciphered by the
 other one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A software component that has to be authenticated, such as a secured server,
 may now be configured to deliver to any client the previously generated
 certificate (contained in 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
).
 It also has to load the associated certificate private key.
 That private key is used to cipher data transmited to the client.
 On the other side, the client uses the public key embedded in the accepted
 server certificate to decipher the data from the server and cipher the
 data to be sent back to the server so that the server can decipher with
 its private key.
 If the client is configured to trust any certificate that have been signed
 by the signing CA, it will be able to authenticate any certificate using
 the CA public key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SSL features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL package supports both PEM and DER encrypted materials.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "DER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules)"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules"

\end_inset

 is an ASN.1 encoding of information, PEM (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Enhanced_Mail"

\end_inset

) is a base64 encoding of a DER encoded data with a header "-----BEGIN "
 and a trailer "-----END " followed by a material type name.
 A PEM file may be de-encrypted or encrypted with AES128 or AES256 ciphers
 only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LiteSSL also supports the pkcs8 encoding that is a private key encryption
 format.
 But it supports only one ciphering algorithm that is PBE-SHA1-RC4-128.
 Here is the command line to convert a PEM encoded private key into a pkcs8
 encoded format.
 Always use the 
\family typewriter
.p8
\family default
 file suffix to identify the pkcs8 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in mykey.pem -inform PEM -out mykey.p8 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

-outform DER -v1 PBE-SHA1-RC4-128
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will have to enter a password, that will be required to use the private
 key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LiteSSL also supports pkcs12 that is a certificate/private key encryption
 format.
 But it supports only one ciphering algorithm that is PBE-SHA1-RC4-128.
 Here is the command line to convert certificate and its associate encoded
 private key into a pkcs12 encoded format.
 Always use the 
\family typewriter
.p12
\family default
 file suffix to identify the pkcs12 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.pem -out server.p12 -name 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

"myserver" -inkey server.key -certpbe PBE-SHA1-RC4-128 -keypbe 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

PBE-SHA1-RC4-128
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will have to enter a password, that will be required to use the private
 key embedded in the pkcs12 encoded file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Applet version is implemented on top of SUN's JSSE.
 This TLS implementation has some limitations that prevent the use of some
 security material formats supported by SSL on devices.
 Thus, private keys have to be in pkcs8 format only.
 Moreover, they can't be password protected.
 You have to add the 
\family typewriter
-nocrypt
\family default
 option to the command line provided above to convert a PEM encoded private
 key to pkcs8 encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SSL usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
SSLUtil
\family default
 class provides functions to get information about the TLS stack layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first class to instantiate is 
\family typewriter
SSLClient
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
SSLServer
\family default
 (not currently supported).
 This class represents an SSL client or server context both inheriting from
 the 
\family typewriter
SSLCTX
\family default
 class that provides many SSL context common services.
 The main feature concerns the security material loading.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad()
\family default
 to load material from files or memory.
 The arguments of this function are the material type (CA, X509 certificate,
 private keys, etc), the filename or the memory containing the material,
 and finally a password for private keys loading if they are password based
 encrypted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To succeed the handshake with a server, you have to trust its self-signed
 certificate or trust the CA certificate who signed the server's certificate.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_X509_CACERT, “cacert.pem”, null)
\family default
 to trust the server's signing CA.
 If the server requires client authentication, you will have to send your
 own client certificate.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_X509_CERT, “mycert.pem”, null)
\family default
 to load your client certificate and 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_RSA_KEY, 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

“mykey.pem”, “pass”)
\family default
 to load the client certificate associated private key protected by the
 
\family typewriter
pass
\family default
 password.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, you have to call 
\family typewriter
connect()
\family default
 on the context instance to create an SSL instance linked with a previously
 created socket.
 The SSL handshake starts immediatly to try to establish an authenticated/cipher
ed communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL handshake succeeded if the 
\family typewriter
connect()
\family default
 call returns an SSL instance and the
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

handshakeStatus()
\family default
 function call on that instance returns 
\family typewriter
SSL_OK
\family default
.
 Consequently, you may check the subject of the peer certificate with the
 
\family typewriter
getCertificateDN()
\family default
 call to identify it and the context could be used to write and read ciphered
 data until the “dispose” call terminates the SSL communication.
 The peer receives a protocol alert to signal a link shutdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL write of data returns the amount of bytes written or an error if
 the writing failed.
 The SSL read of data may return 
\family typewriter
SSL_OK
\family default
 that indicates that the read is not yet terminated and may be called again
 to achieve the reading of a block of decipherable data.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This package has the following classes, whose JavaDocs in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.net.mail
\family default
 should be read:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class represents an Internet e-mail address using the syntax of RFC822.
 Typical address syntax is of the form 
\family typewriter
user@host.domain
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Personal Name
\family default
 
\family typewriter
<user@host.domain>
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DataContentHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an abstract class that defines the basic interface for implementations
 of 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

DataContentHandler
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
BinaryContentHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is an implementation of 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
 that handles MIME types handled as base64 encoded byte arrays.
 It also handle streams, reading from the input stream on demand to avoid
 excessive memory load.
 This will usually be slower than reading the whole content of the stream
 to a byte array and using it as the 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
TextContentHandler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is an implementation of 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
 that handles textual (not encoded) MIME types.
 This class is similar to the previous one, except for the fact that if
 
\family typewriter
obj
\family default
 is not a 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter
writeTo()
\family default
 method, it will be transformed into a 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DataHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class maps a MIME type into an instance of a 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MailSession
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is used to store properties used by the messaging API.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SMTP protocol provider supports the following properties, which may
 be set in the MailSession object.
 The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes how
 the string is interpreted.
 For example, use 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

props.put("mail.smtp.port", "888"); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

to set the 
\family typewriter
mail.smtp.port
\family default
 property, which is of type 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption
 of electronic data established by the U.S.
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002.
 The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the
 same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
 AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation
 network, and is fast in both software and hardware.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the presumed
 difficulty of factoring large integers, the factoring problem.
 RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly
 described it in 1977.
 A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime
 numbers, along with an auxiliary value, as their public key.
 The prime factors must be kept secret.
 Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently
 published methods, if the public key is large enough, only someone with
 knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message.
 Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question
 known as the RSA problem.

\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function
 that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.
 MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is
 also commonly used to check data integrity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SHA1Digest 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements the SHA-1 message digest algorithm.
 It is similar to 
\family typewriter
MD5Digest
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cryptography, SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function.
 SHA stands for "secure hash algorithm".
 The three SHA algorithms are structured differently and are distinguished
 as SHA-0, SHA-1, and SHA-2.
 SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but corrects an error in the original SHA
 hash specification that led to significant weaknesses.
 The SHA-0 algorithm was not adopted by many applications.
 SHA-2 on the other hand significantly differs from the SHA-1 hash function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions, and is
 employed in several widely used applications and protocols, including TLS
 and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements the SHA-256 message digest algorithm.
 It is similar to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHA-256 is part of a family of two similar hash functions with different
 block sizes, known as SHA-256 and SHA-512.
 They differ in the word size; SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses
 64-bit words.
 There are also truncated versions of each standardized, known as SHA-224
 and SHA-384.
 All of them are part of the SHA-2.

DiscoveryAgent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
DiscoveryAgent
\family default
 class provides methods to perform device and service discovery.
 A local device must have only one 
\family typewriter
DiscoveryAgent
\family default
 object.
 This object must be retrieved by a call to 
\family typewriter
getDiscoveryAgent()
\family default
 on the 
\family typewriter
LocalDevice
\family default
 object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
RemoteDevice 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
RemoteDevice
\family default
 class represents a remote Bluetooth device.
 It provides basic information about a remote device including the device's
 Bluetooth address and its friendly name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
ServiceRecord 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
ServiceRecord
\family default
 class describes characteristics of a Bluetooth service.
 A 
\family typewriter
ServiceRecord
\family default
 object contains a set of service attributes, where each service attribute
 is an (ID, value) pair.
 A Bluetooth attribute ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer, and an attribute
 value is a 
\family typewriter
DataElement
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure and use of service records is specified by the Bluetooth specifica
tion in the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) document.
 Most of the Bluetooth Profile specifications also describe the structure
 of the service records used by the Bluetooth services that conform to the
 profile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An SDP Server maintains a Service Discovery Database (SDDB) of service records
 that describe the services on the local device.
 Remote SDP clients can use the SDP to query an SDP server for any service
 records of interest.
 A service record provides sufficient information to allow an SDP client
 to connect to the Bluetooth service on the SDP server's device.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ServiceRecord
\family default
s are made available to a client application via an argument of the

\family typewriter
ServiceRecord
\family default
s are available to server applications via the method 
\family typewriter
LocalDevice.getRecord(Connection)
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There might be many service attributes in a service record, and the SDP
 protocol makes it possible to specify the subset of the service attributes
 that an SDP client wants to retrieve from a remote service record.
 The 
\family typewriter
ServiceRecord
\family default
 interface treats certain service attribute IDs as default IDs, and, if
 present, these service attributes are automatically retrieved during service
 searches.

UUID
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
UUID
\family default
 class defines universally unique identifiers.
 These 128-bit unsigned integers are guaranteed to be unique across all
 time and space.
 Accordingly, an instance of this class is immutable.
 The Bluetooth specification provides an algorithm describing how a 16-bit
 or 32-bit UUID could be promoted to a 128-bit UUID.
 Accordingly, this class provides an interface that assists applications
 in creating 16-bit, 32-bit, and 128-bit long UUIDs.
 The methods supported by this class allow equality testing of two UUID
 objects.

\begin_layout Part
BLUETOOTH PRINTERS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part describes classes used to send commands to Bluetooth printers.
 For more details, check out the
\family typewriter
 totalcross.io.device.printer
\family default
 package JavaDocs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
BluetoothPrinter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Used as interface to printers that uses Bluetooth as default to communicate
 with the device.
 Altough the class has this name, you can use any port a 
\family typewriter
PortConnector
\family default
 and your device and printer support, such as USB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: during tests, we found that some printers require to fill their buffer
 to start printing.
 So, if you have problems printing, try the following code after you instantiate
 this class: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cp = new BluetoothPrinter(); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cp.write(new byte[2048]); // fill the buffer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cp.newLine(); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

...
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
CitizenPrinter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class extends 
\family typewriter
BluetoothPrinter
\family default
 to send special Citizen-like commands to the printer.
 Tested with Citizen CMP-10 thermal printer.
 Similar to its superclass, the connection with the printer may use any
 supported port, not necessarily Bluetooth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instructions of how to setup the devices to work with the printer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First, run the self-test: turning the printer off, and pressing the LF +
 ON button at the same time and then releasing the LF button.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write down the last 2 bytes (4 letters) of the ADDRESS (e.g.: A4 08) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Discover the "Citizen Systems" printer with the device.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When asked for the PIN (password), write the last 4 letters of the address
 in UPPER CASE (e.g.: A408); if it fails, write it in lower case (e.g.: a408).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
That's it.
 On some devices, you can choose to always use this printer as default bluetooth
 device.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
MonoImage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 class that can be used to save 1-bpp images and print on monochromatic
 printers.
 Only black pixels are printed, non-black are ignored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
XML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following chapters describes the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.xml
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
totalcross.xml.rpc
\family default
 packages.
 For more details, check out their classes JavaDocs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
totalcross.xml
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root of the package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.xml
\family default
 has classes for tokenizing a XML file.
 It has the following classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
XmlTokenizer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Tokenizer for XML input.
 In non-strict mode (default), it recognizes HTML constructs as well, e.g.:
 unquoted attributes value, unterminated references, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four 
\family typewriter
tokenize()
\family default
 methods are provided: one takes a 
\family typewriter
byte[]
\family default
 array; another takes a 
\family typewriter
byte[]
\family default
 array with offset and count; another one for an HTML document which is
 embedded within an HTTP stream; and the last takes a (byte) 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tokenization events are reported via overridable methods: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundStartOfInput() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundStartTagName() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundEndTagName() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundEndEmptyTag() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundCharacterData() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundCharacter() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundAttributeName() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundAttributeValue() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundComment() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundProcessingInstruction() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundDeclaration() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundReference() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foundEndOfInput() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of these methods pass the parameters pertinent to the kind of tokenized
 events: tag name, attribute name and value...
 These values are only valid for the time the event is reported.
 Never assume that, after returning from a 
\family typewriter
foundXxx()
\family default
 method, the information that was reported is still available! Persistent
 values are however provided through the 
\family typewriter
getAbsoluteOffset()
\family default
 method, which returns the absolute offset of the current parameters of
 the 
\family typewriter
foundXxx()
\family default
 method.
 
\end_layout

Typical invocation taken from its dumb subclass 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note: A Tokenizer is not a Parser.
 The correctness of the tag structure (stack) is not examined.
 Ex: the dangling markup 
\family typewriter
<foo><bar>opop</foo>
\family default
 is syntactically valid.
 As a result, a Tokenizer can work on document fragments.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
XmlReader
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class extends 
\family typewriter
XmlTokenizer
\family default
 and is used to read HTML or XML documents, reporting events to handlers
 (for example, the class 
\family typewriter
ContentHandler
\family default
 described below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note: While in the SAX 2.0 spirit, this implementation is not fully compliant.
 Speed and footprint took precedence over what the author judged being details.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike SAX, reporting tag names, like in 
\family typewriter
ContentHandler.startElement()
\family default
, passes an integral tag code rather than the name itself.
 This is, again, for performance reasons.
 Comparing integers vs.
 string is notably more efficient and tag name comparison is heavily used
 for XML applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tag code must uniquely identify the name of the tag.
 The default implementation — see 
\family typewriter
getTagCode()
\family default
 — simply consists to hash the tag name.
 It can be overriden to suit specific needs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tag names should be translated to tag codes as soon are they are known,
 when reading the DTD for instance, or computed in advance and saved into
 a static correspondence table.

 is an interface that abstracts any sequential resource that can be passed
 to an 
\family typewriter
XmlReader
\family default
.
 A class that implements this interface must have the following methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
readXml(XmlReader
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

rdr) 
\family default
Reads the 
\family typewriter
XmlReadable
\family default
 through an 
\family typewriter
XmlReader
\family default
 parser, where 
\family typewriter
rdr
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
XmlReader
\family default
 that will report the SAX events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
getBaseURI()
\family default
 Gets the base URI attached to the 
\family typewriter
XmlReadable
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
setCaseInsensitive(boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

caseInsensitive)
\family default
 Pass 
\family typewriter
true
\family default

\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\family default
 attached object to be case insensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\family typewriter
XmlReadable
\family default
 from a

XmlReadableByteArray
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

XmlReader rdr = new XmlReader();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

rdr.setContentHandler(...);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
XmlReadablePort 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class makes an 
\family typewriter
XmlReadable
\family default
 from a 
\family typewriter
PortConnector
\family default
 extending 
\family typewriter
XmlReadableByteArray
\family default
.
 It can only be used on Windows 32 and Java SE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

XmlReader rdr = new XmlReader();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
AttributeList
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class describes the attributes attached to a start-tag.
 Tags are case-insensitive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
AttributeListIterator
\family default
 class provides an iterator over the components of each attribute in an
 
\family typewriter
AttributeList
\family default
 instance: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the attribute name 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the unquoted value 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the quote, if one exist 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ContentHandler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class receives notification of the logical content of a document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the main interface that most SAX applications implement: if the
 application needs to be informed of basic parsing events, it implements
 this interface and registers an instance with the XML reader using the
 
\family typewriter
XmlReader.setContentHandler(ContentHandler)
\family default
 method.
 The XML reader uses the instance to report basic document-related events
 like the start and end of elements and character data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The order of events in this interface is very important, and mirrors the
 order of information in the document itself.
 For example, all of an element's content (character data, processing instructio
ns, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between the 
\family typewriter
startElement()
\family default
 event and the corresponding 
\family typewriter
endElement()
\family default
 event.

\begin_layout Standard
This class provides client-side HTTP communication.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
CompressedHttpClient 
\end_layout

 that it uses compression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
XmlRpcClient
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is an 
\family typewriter
XmlReader
\family default
 and handles XML-RPCs to a server.
 Its objects cannot be reused.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class extends 
\family typewriter
ContentHandler
\family default
 and its methods are called by the XML parser used in 
\family typewriter
XmlRpcClient
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Part
BARCODE SCANNER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part, two ways of decoding information from a barcode will be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Scanner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.Scanner
\family default
 class allows the usage of the barcode reader of some of the most popular
 scanners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For TotalCross 3.0 only Intermec Android scanner is supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scanner access is only available when running on a native TotalCross VM;
 it is not supported when running on Java.
 It is, though, emulated on Java: a popup dialog will ask you for a barcode
 symbol which will be returned every time the 
\family typewriter
getData()
\family default
 method is called.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there is only one scanner per device, the 
\family typewriter
Scanner
\family default
 class is static.
 Activating the scanner causes the physical scanner to be powered, and enables
 the trigger.
 Deactivating the scanner removes the power from the scanner and prevents
 scans from taking place.
 The scanner should always be deactivated at the end of processing to prevent
 excessive battery drain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that if the scanner is deactivate in the device settings, you won't
 be able to activate it using the application.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the scanner is activated, scan events will appear in the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method.
 The scan events will contain a string describing either the item scanned
 or a battery error.
 Deactivating the scanner prevents scan events from being delivered.
 If you want that another class fetches the scanner events, you should pass
 a control as a listener and fetch them in its 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method.
 If it is a window, it should be opened using 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can change this behaviour on some devices by calling 
\family typewriter
setContinuousScanning(
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

false)
\family default
, which will cause each call to 
\family typewriter
activate()
\family default
 to only allow a single scan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since barcodes can have many formats, this class includes a method to register
 the barcode types with the scanner.
 These types must each be individually set as parameters to the scanner.
 After all the parameter types have been set, the 
\family typewriter
commitBarcodeParams()
\family default
 method must be called to register the parameters with the scanner (this
 is not necessary on Intermec Android).
 Once this is done the scanner is able to decode the specified barcode types.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical processing sequence is given below: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (!Scanner.activate() 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 || !Scanner.setBarcodeParam(Scanner...., true)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 || !Scanner.setBarcodeParam(Scanner...., true)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 || !Scanner.commitBarcodeParams()) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (!Scanner.deactivate()) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note: the Java emulation works the same as on device.
 On Java activating the scanner only schedules a single scan.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We obviously need this class to behave in the same way on both platforms.
 Rather than forcing one choice on the user, the 
\family typewriter
continuousScanning
\family default
 flag allows the user to choose which mode they want.

OPTIMIZATION TRICKS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this small, but highly important chapter, is to teach you
 how to improve your Java application's speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross VM has an interpreter, which makes it a little slow for certain
 types of applications.
 It is not feasible to program in the same way for 1 GHz (a typical mobile
 device processor) and 3 GHz processors (a typical desktop processor).
 Moreover, a desktop has much more RAM.
 By following the tricks presented in this tutorial, you'll be able to improve
 your application's performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These tips and tricks can make a very big difference in speed not only when
 running your program on mobile devices, but also on desktop systems.
 Most of them can be used in any Java environment, and are actually referenced
 in other books and tutorials, but others are explicitly TotalCross optimization
 tricks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some proof timings (measured in microseconds – µ = 1 second /
 1,000,000) near a clock bullet.
 They are always shown per iteration, ie, taken the total time and divided
 by the number or iterations.
 All tests were performed on the following devices:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 8.1, iCore 5, 2 x 2.80 GHz, 5 Gb RAM, 192 Gb disk size - named Win
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Android 4.4.2, Motorola Moto G, 4 x 1.2 GHz, 1 Gb RAM, 16 Gb disk size - named
 Android
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Tricks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid method calls.
 Method calls in TotalCross (and, actually, in any platform or virtual machine)
 are extremely expensive when comparing to in-lined code.
 This is the most important optimization trick and several other tricks
 inherit from this one.
 Lets see some common mistakes that people make:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Don't use method calls as the stop condition in for loops (assume 
\family typewriter
v
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Win: 00.00, Android: 00.67, iPhone: 00.47
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can change it in a couple of ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

int n = v.size();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (int i=0; i < n; i++)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Win: 00.00, Android: 00.27, iPhone: 00.20
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 if the order of the loop matters, or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (int i=v.size()-1; i >= 0; i--)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Win: 00.40, Android: 00.20, iPhone: 00.13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 if the order of the loop doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same care can be taken with an array's 
\family typewriter
length
\family default
 property.
 It always takes extra time to get the field, so it's better to assign it
 to a temporary variable and use it in the loop, or use the previous suggestions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid using get and set methods.
 This may go against standard object oriented practices, but in small devices
 it is necessary that you avoid this.
 If you have a simple member that is protected or private, and is set and
 get by using something like: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

protected String s;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public void setS(String newS) {s = newS;}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Win: 00.08, Android: 00.46, iPhone: 00.38
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be better to make the member public and access it directly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public String s;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
direct get (
\family typewriter
...
 = s
\family default
): Win: 00.02, Android: 00.19, iPhone: 00.15
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note about final classes: in the first JDK versions (up to 1.1.x), making
 the get/set methods final or making the whole class final would make the
 compiler inline the methods when using the 
\family typewriter
-O
\family default
 compiler option.
 From JDK 1.2.x and beyond this no longer holds true.
 We plan, however, to make the TotalCross' deployer inline methods, thus
 re-allowing the programmer to use get/set methods.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Any other methods that are used in a loop are good candidates to be inlined
 directly.
 But please have good sense when doing this.
 There's no need to inline all your program in one big block.
 Just make sure you optimize the very inner loop and that's it.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid using Interfaces.
 If you have an interface that is frequently used (maybe in a loop) in your
 application, change it to an abstract class, if possible.
 This is necessary because interface methods cannot be dynamically bound
 by the VM, thus each method call must be looked up in the methods table
 each time it is called.
 In normal and in abstract classes, the method is looked up only once and
 then its address is bound and used in all subsequent calls.

x<<1

 The same is valid for divisions:

 But be careful: this only works for positive numbers.

 Not always the best approach for one platform is also the best for the

 array provided by

 data types are slower than using

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll use the TotalCrossAPI sample that comes with the SDK to skip the programmi
ng and focus on the project setup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a new Java Project: Open the menu File and click on New > Java Project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Choose a project name for your project and click on Finish.
 We'll use TotalCrossAPI.
 Then click on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Finish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Expand the newly created project and right-click on the folder “src” and
 choose “Import...”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the new “Import” dialog shown, expand the folder “General”, select “File
 System” and click “Next >”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now write the complete file path to the TotalCrossAPI example, or use “Browse”
 to navigate to the file system.
 Our source is located at 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/src/tc/samples/api/
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the left box, check the folder 
\family typewriter
api
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the edit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Into folder:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, write 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossAPI/src/tc/samples
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we can see our project is displaying several build errors.
 To fix this, right-click on the project and choose “Properties”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the left panel, select “Java Build Path”; Then, on the right panel, click
 on the “Libraries” tab and on the button “Add External JARs...”; Browse your
 file system to 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist
\family default
 and select the file 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now the “Libraries” tab should also show the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
.
 Expand it and select “Javadoc location”.
 Now click on the button “Edit...” to open a new dialog, then browse your file
 system and select the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/docs/html/
\family default
 directory and press “Ok” to confirm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the “Libraries” tab, select “Source attachment” and click on the
 button “Edit...” to open a new dialog, then browse your file system and select
 the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/src
\family default
 directory and press “Ok” to confirm.
 This finishes the build path configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Look again at the left panel and select “Java Compiler”.
 Check the option “Enable project specific settings” and change the “Compiler
 compliance level” to “1.8”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Press “Ok” to confirm and close the “Properties” dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Re-build the project and the build errors should all be gone (skip this
 step if your Eclipse is configured to build automatically in Preferences-->Work
space).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Logging errors Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have developped a way to automatically generate an error log.
 In our case, the log is sent by email on each data synchronization.
 Thus, it is possible to catch errors that occur when the application is
 in production and the user can't send the device to us.
 The code written here is NOT in the SDK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, you need to centralize all exception processing to throw them into
 a file.
 We must also find out if the program aborted for some reason.
 With the class below you can do this for Android.
 You can change it for other devices:

Observations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
GerenciamentoDeErros
\family default
 class allows logging everything.
 AVOID THAT: only errors should be there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In our synchronization, we send the log error using a servlet; if you preffer
 using a webservice, you must implement something different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the server, we get the report and send it by e-mail directly to the developer
 support service.
 If the report has errors in the VM, you should open a request in our support
 service with the error log and addicional information to help us to reproduce
 the errors.
