/*
 * This class is almost identical to java.util.Hashtable, with some
modifications.
 */

/**
 * This class implements a hashtable, which maps keys to values. Both
 * key and value must be integer values.
 * If an error occurs, an Exception is returned. 
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>Hashtable</code> has two parameters that
 * affect its efficiency: its <i>capacity</i> and its <i>load
 * factor</i>. The load factor should be between 0.0 and 1.0. When
 * the number of entries in the hashtable exceeds the product of the
 * load factor and the current capacity, the capacity is increased by
 * calling the <code>rehash</code> method. Larger load factors use
 * memory more efficiently, at the expense of larger expected time
 * per lookup.
 * <p>
 * If many entries are to be made into a <code>Hashtable</code>,
 * creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
 * entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.
 * <p>
 * This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
 * the numbers as keys:
 * <pre>
 *     IntHashtable numbers = new IntHashtable(10);
 *     numbers.put(1, 1000);
 *     numbers.put(2, 2000);
 *     numbers.put(3, 3000);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To retrieve a number, use the following code:
 * <pre>
 *     int i = numbers.get(2);
      // "two = " + i;
 * </pre>
 * Don't forget to catch the ElementNotFoundException in the methods it is thrown.
