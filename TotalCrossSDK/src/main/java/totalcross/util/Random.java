/** This is a simple Linear Congruential Generator which
    produces random numbers in the range [0,2^31), derived
    from ran0 in Numerical Recipies.  Note that ran0 isn't
    wonderfully random -- there are much better generators
    out there -- but it'll do the job, and it's fast and
    has low memory consumption.
    <p>
    Here's a sample of how to use the Random class:
    <pre>
    Random r = new Random(0x1234); // the use of the same key is sometimes desirable
    for (...)
    {
       int nextRandomInt = r.between(0,10);
       char nextRandomChar = r.between('a','z');
       ...
    }
