   * int result = Vm.exec(&quot;scandir&quot;, &quot;/p mydir&quot;, 0, true);

   *
   * The args parameter passed to this method is the arguments string to pass to the program being executed.
   * <p>
   * The launchCode parameter was only used under PalmOS. It is no longer used.
   * <p>
   * The wait parameter passed to this method determines whether to execute the command asynchronously. If false, then
   * the method will return without waiting for the command to complete execution. If true, the method will wait for
   * the program to finish executing and the return value of the method will be the value returned from the application
   * under Java, Win32 and WinCE.
   * <p>
   * To run another TotalCross program from Windows CE devices, use:
   *
   * <pre>
   * Vm.exec(&quot;\\TotalCross\\Path\\Program.exe&quot;, null, 0, false);
   * </pre>
   * Here's a sample of how to run the Internet Explorer in Windows CE:
   * <pre>
   * Vm.exec("\\windows\\iexplore.exe","about:blank",0,false);
   * </pre>
   * You cannot pass null nor "" in the args, or you'll get error 87. IExplore requires a page to open; in this case,
   * we open the blank page.
   *
   * In other words, you must call the program's executable.
   * <p>
   * When calling a TotalCross program, you can pass a command line parameter to the calling application, just placing
   * the parameters in the proper argument. It can be retrieved with <code>getCommandLine</code> method from the
   * MainWindow.
   * <p>
   * In some platforms, the caller application must be quit by calling <code>exit</code>.
   * <p>
   * In Windows 98 and beyond, if you don't pass the full path to the file, it is searched in the current PATH
   * environment variable. The command must contain only the exe name, and all the other arguments must being the args
   * parameter. For example, the following code uses the CMD to open a file with the proper editor:
   *
   * <pre>
   * Vm.exec(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c start C:\\WINNT\\DirectX.log&quot;, 0, false);
   * </pre>
   * Important notes about path separators:
   * <ul>
   * <li>In the companion we tell to always use / as the path separator. Vm.exec must be used differently of the other
   * places, because you don't pass only paths in the args parameter, pass other things too. So, when you use a path
   * in File, we convert the / to the target separator (\ or /), but in Vm.exec we can't do that, for example,
   * changing "/c start" to "\c start" will make the execution fail. So, you'll have to choose the right separator in the
   * parameters.
   * <li> Make sure that, in Windows, the paths and parameters use \\, not / as path separator, or the command will not
   * run.
   * </ul>
   * If you're using /cmd and the command fails, change /c option to /k, which will keep the open window instead
   * of closing it, so you can see the error cause.
   *<p>
   * In Android, you can launch an application, an url at the browser, execute a shell command, or install an apk:
   * <ul>
   * <li> Vm.exec("cmd","logcat -d -f /sdcard/error.log -v time *:I",0,true); -- creates the adb report (useful to get errors - note that you must wait for the file to be created, since the wait parameter does not work - like File f = new File("/sdcard/error.log"); while (!f.exists()) Vm.sleep(500);)
   * <li> Vm.exec("url","http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=abraham+lincoln",0,true); -- launches a url
   * <li> Vm.exec("url","file:///sdcard/bunny.3gp",0,true); -- launches default app to open the program associated with the 'Video/3gpp' MIME-type passing the URI 'file:///sdcard/bunny.3gp' (see https://gitlab.com/totalcross/TotalCross/issues/61 and https://gitlab.com/totalcross/TotalCross/wikis/Features/open-known-files-in-Android)
   * <li> Vm.exec("url", "googlechrome://navigate?url=" + "file:///storage/emulated/0/BuilderLynx/pics/Page.html", 0, true); -- launches Google Chrome to open 'file:///storage/emulated/0/BuilderLynx/pics/Page.html' (see https://gitlab.com/totalcross/TotalCross/issues/57)
   * <li> Vm.exec("totalcross.app.uigadgets","UIGadgets",0,false); -- launches another TotalCross application
   * <li> Vm.exec("com.android.calculator2","Calculator",0,true); -- runs the Calculator program 
   * <li> Vm.exec("/sdcard/myapp.apk",null,0,false); -- calls the apk installation tool. To access the card in Android devices, prefix the path with <code>/sdcard</code>. Be sure that the sdcard is NOT MOUNTED, otherwise your application will not have access to it.
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer","file:///sdcard/files/chlorine-bogusInfo.txt", 0, true); -- uses an internal viewer to show the txt file to the user (here, stored in the sdcard, but could be anywhere). Also accepts HTML.  Also accepts HTML and JPG files. 
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer","/sdcard/Download/handbook.pdf",0,true); -- opens a pdf. Note: you must have a pdf reader installed; search for the free adobe reader in your favorite store. Returns -1 if args is null, -2 if file was not found.
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer","/sdcard/photo1.jpg",0,true); -- opens a jpeg/jpg/png image so the image can be panned and zoomed. Returns -1 if args is null, -2 if file was not found.
   * <li> Vm.exec("totalcross.appsrvc","TCService",0,true); -- starts the given service
   * <li> Vm.exec("broadcast","broadcast package",flags,true); -- sends a broadcast intent. "flag" is used in intent.addFlags if different of 0.
   * <li> Vm.exec("intent","{\"package\":\"com.company.application\",\"data\":\"file:///sdcard/something.pdf\",\"type\":\"application/pdf\"}",flags,true); -- starts an Intent with given values for package, data and type. The args value is expected to be a valid json object, you may use the class JSONObject to get a valid json string.
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * In iOS, the following work as in Android. Note that since iOS does not have a sdcard, you must extract or copy the files to your application's directory (Settings.appPath).
   * <ul>
   * <li> Vm.exec("url","http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=abraham+lincoln",0,true); -- launches a url
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer",Settings.appPath+"/chlorine-bogusInfo.txt", 0, true); -- uses an internal viewer to show the txt file to the user (here, stored in the sdcard, but could be anywhere). Also accepts HTML. Also accepts HTML and JPG files. 
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer",Settings.appPath+"/handbook.pdf",0,true); -- opens a pdf. WORKS also for XLS, DOC, and all file types that the <code>UIWebView</code> component can show. A PDF reader is NOT required.
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer",Settings.appPath+"/photo1.jpg",0,true); -- opens a jpeg/jpg/png image so the image can be panned and zoomed.
   * </ul>
   * In Win32, you can also use the "viewer" or "url" to open files and web pages:
   * <ul>
   * <li> Vm.exec("url","http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=abraham+lincoln",0,true); -- launches a url
   * <li> Vm.exec("viewer","c:\\handbook.pdf",0,true); -- opens a pdf. WORKS also for XLS, DOC, and other registered extensions.
   * </ul>
   * In Win32 you can find if a program is running by using "running process", and passing the exe's filename (case insensitive):
   * <ul>
   * <li> int ret = Vm.exec("running process", "explorer.exe",0,false) == 1;
   * </ul>
   * 
   * To be able to find what's the class name of a program you want to launch, install it in the Android Emulator
   * (which is inside the Android SDK) and run the "Dev Tools" / Package Browser. Then click on the package, and click
   * in the desired Activities button. The <code>command</code> parameter for Vm.exec is the "Process" description, and the 
   * <code>args</code> parameter is the activitie's name. Note, however, that there's no guarantee that the program
   * will be available in a real device.
   * <p>
   * To install a cab file in Windows Mobile, you can use:
   * <pre>
   * Vm.exec("wceload.exe", fullPathToCabFile, 0, true);
   * </pre>
   * However, trying to update the program itself or the vm will close the program. So, update it at last.
   * 
   * @param command the command to execute
   * @param args command arguments.
   * @param launchCode no longer used.
   * @param wait whether to wait for the command to complete execution before returning. If wait is false,
   * don't forget to call the <code>exit</code> method right after this command is called, otherwise the application may
   * not be called. In Android, if you're calling a TotalCross program, the wait parameter is ignored (and defaults to false). 
   * @return Usually is 0 if no error occured, or a system error code. -999 means that the file was not found. In Android, is always 0.
