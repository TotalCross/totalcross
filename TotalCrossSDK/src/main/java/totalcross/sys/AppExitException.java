/**
 * This exception is thrown when <code>Event.handleOneEvent()</code> finds an event that requires the application to exit. The main purpose of this

 * when a window is open with the <code>popup()</code> method.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: DO NOT CATCH THIS EXCEPTION IN YOUR APP UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
