   * While this interface method is declared to throw <code>Exception</code>,
   * implementers are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to declare concrete
   * implementations of the <code>close</code> method to throw more specific
   * exceptions, or to throw no exception at all if the close operation cannot

   * <p>
   * Cases where the close operation may fail require careful attention by
   * implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish the underlying resources
   * and to internally <em>mark</em> the resource as closed, prior to throwing
   * the exception. The <code>close</code> method is unlikely to be invoked more
   * than once and so this ensures that the resources are released in a timely
   * manner. Furthermore it reduces problems that could arise when the resource
   * wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource.

   * Note that unlike the
   * <a href="../../totalcross/io/Closeable.html#close--"><code>close</code></a>
   * method of <a href="../../totalcross/io/Closeable.html" title="interface in
   * totalcross.io"><code>Closeable</code></a>, this <code>close</code> method
   * is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent. In other words, calling this
   * <code>close</code> method more than once may have some visible side effect,
   * unlike <code>Closeable.close</code> which is required to have no effect if
   * called more than once.
   * 
   * However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged to make
   * their <code>close</code> methods idempotent.
