/**
 * This class creates sockets. It may be subclassed by other factories, which create particular subclasses of sockets
 * and thus provide a general framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality.
 * 
 * Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies related to the sockets being constructed,
 * producing such sockets in a way which does not require special configuration of the code which asks for the sockets:
 * 
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different kinds of sockets can be used by the same application
 * code just by passing it different kinds of factories.
 * 
 * <LI>Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used in socket construction. So for example, factories
 * could be customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts or security parameters already configured.
 * 
 * <LI>The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose
 * new APIs for features such as compression, security, record marking, statistics collection, or firewall tunneling.
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration mechanisms. For example, the getDefault method
 * could return a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a framework could use a factory
 * customized to its own purposes.
