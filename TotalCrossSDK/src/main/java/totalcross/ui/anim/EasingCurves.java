/**
 * This class provides static functions for the most common easing curves
 * used around the world and on most design guides, such as Google's
 * Material Design [1]
 * 
 * In curves are used to approach a value at maximum speed
 * Out curves are used to approach a value at zero speed
 * InOut curves mixes the in and out curves, creating a S-shaped curve
 * Elastic curves extrapolate both begin and end values a little for a
 * visually pleasant effect
 * Bounce curves arrive at the end value multiple times before settling in, 
 * creating a bouncy effect.
 * 
 * Illustrations of these curves can be seen at [2]
 * For a reference implementation, see [3]
 * 
 * All easing curves take 4 parameters: the begin and end values, the
 * animation duration and the position we want to evaluate on the curve
 *
