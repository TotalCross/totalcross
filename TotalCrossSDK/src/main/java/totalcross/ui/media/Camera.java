/**
 * This class is used to enable the camera of the underlying device. The following platforms are supported:
 * Windows Mobile devices, Blackberry, Palm OS, Android and iOS.
 * 
 * For more information about the possible parameters on Windows, see: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb431794.aspx 
 * 
 * See the CameraTest sample. 
 * 
 * Note that you can easily rotate the image to put it in portrait mode, using the
 * <code>Image.getRotatedScaledInstance</code> method, after retrieving the image. 
 * 
 * To use this class with the Hand Held Dolphin barcode scanners, you must install
 * TotalCross3/dist/vm/wince/POCKETPC/ARM/Dolphin.dll. Only 640x480 photos are supported, and you may change the
 * following options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>initialDir
 * <li>defaultFileName (must end with jpg)
 * <li>resolutionWidth x resolutionHeight: possible values are 640x480 and 212x160 (different values defaults to
 * 640x480)
 * </ul>
 * All other options are ignored.
 * 
 * In Android you can set the defaultFileName, stillQuality, resolutionWidth and resolutionHeight. All other options are ignored.
 * 
 * You can call the getSupportedResolutions method to see the resolutions that are available at the device. 
 * 
 * In iOS there's no way to return the supported resolutions; it will take a photo using the default camera's resolution, and 
 * then will resize to the resolution defined in resolutionWidth/resolutionHeight, keeping the camera's aspect ratio. In iOS you can specify the defaultFileName with a path or just the name, or use a system-generated name. 
 * 
 * In Android, you can use the internal camera by setting the cameraType field.

 * 
 * @see #getSupportedResolutions()
