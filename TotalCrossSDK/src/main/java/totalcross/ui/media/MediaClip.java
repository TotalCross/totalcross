/**
 * MediaClip is a sound clip. It will be updated in the future to support movie clips.
 * <p>
 * Support for sound clips varies between platforms. Some Java virtual machines support .wav and .au sound files and
 * some versions don't seem to support either format.
 * <p>
 * Using a TotalCross Virtual Machine, .wav format sound clips are supported under Win32, WinCE and Palm OS. Under Win32
 * and WinCE, the .wav files for sound clips may exist in a file outside of the program's tcz file; the wav file can be
 * stored inside a pdb/tcz file (and it has precedence over the one located in the file system).
 * <p>
 * In Palm OS, the wav must be added to the pdb (The Deployer does this automagically. Just reference a .wav and it will
 * be added).
 * <p>
 * If you're playing a sound clip under a Windows CE device and you don't hear anything, make sure that the device is
 * set to allow programs to play sounds. To check the setting, look at:
 * <p>
 * Start->Settings->Volume & Sounds
 * <p>
 * for the check box:
 * <p>
 * Enable sounds for: Programs
 * <p>
 * If it is not checked on, sound clips won't play.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example that plays a sound:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * File soundFile = new File("sound.wav", File.READ_WRITE);
 * MediaClip s = new MediaClip(soundFile);
 * s.start();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Under Palm OS, the currently supported formats are: uncompressed (PCM) or IMA 4-bit adaptive differential (IMA
 * ADPCM). The ADPCM type is also known as DVI ADPCM; in a WAVE file, it's known as format 0x11. One or two-channels;
 * All normal sampling rates (8k, 11k, 22.05k, 44.1k, 48, 96k).
 * <p>
 * Note that some Palm OS devices does not support 16bit waves, so better store them in 8bits.
 * <p>
 * MediaClip also support sound recording. When recording sound, you can only call the record and stop methods. Sound
 * recording does not work under JavaSE.
 * <p>
 * The MediaClip events are broadcasted to the MainWindow controls.
