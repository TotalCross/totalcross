/**
 * An interface for all objects that support loading and saving themselves
 * through the ObjectCatalog class. This works in a similar manner to the
 * Externalizable interface in Java. When saveState() is called, the value of
 * any fields should be written to the given DataStream. When loadState() is
 * called these values should be read back using the equivalent methods, making
 * sure the order remains the same. After loadState() the new object should
 * behave exactly as it did before the corresponding saveState(). Here is an
 * example of the methods in use.
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyClass implements Storable
 * {
 *    int    i;
 *    String s;
 *
 *    public MyClass()
 *    {
 *    }
 *
 *    public MyClass(int i, String s)
 *    {
 *       this.i = i;
 *       this.s = s;
 *    }
 *
 *    public byte getID()
 *    {
 *       return (byte) 123;
 *    }
 *
 *    public Storable getInstance()
 *    {
 *       return new MyClass();
 *    }
 *
 *    public void saveState(DataStream ds)
 *    {
 *       ds.writeInt(i);
 *       ds.writeString(s);
 *    }
 *
 *    public void loadState(DataStream ds)
 *    {
 *       i = ds.readInt();
 *       s = ds.readString();
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
