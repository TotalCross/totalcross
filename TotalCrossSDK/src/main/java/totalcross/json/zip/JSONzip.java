/**
 * JSONzip is a binary-encoded JSON dialect. It is designed to compress the
 * messages in a session in bandwidth constrained applications, such as mobile.
 *
 * JSONzip is adaptive, so with each message seen, it should improve its
 * compression. It minimizes JSON's overhead, reducing punctuation
 * to a small number of bits. It uses Huffman encoding to reduce the average
 * size of characters. It uses caches (or Keeps) to keep recently seen strings
 * and values, so repetitive content (such as object keys) can be
 * substantially reduced. It uses a character encoding called Kim (Keep it
 * minimal) that is smaller than UTF-8 for most East European, African, and
 * Asian scripts.
 *
 * JSONzip tends to reduce most content by about half. If there is a lot of
 * recurring information, the reduction can be much more dramatic.
 *
 * FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS PACKAGE HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED
 * ADEQUATELY FOR PRODUCTION USE.
 *
