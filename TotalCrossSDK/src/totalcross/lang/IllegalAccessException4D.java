package totalcross.lang;

/** 
 * Thrown when you try to load a private class using Class.newInstance. 
 * <br><br>
 * IMPORTANT: the totalcross.lang package is the java.lang that will be used in the device.
 * You CANNOT use nor import totalcross.lang package in desktop. When tc.Deploy is called,
 * all references to java.lang are replaced by totalcross.lang automatically. Given this,
 * you must use only the classes and methods that exists BOTH in java.lang and totalcross.lang.
 * For example, you can't use java.lang.ClassLoader because there are no totalcross.lang.ClassLoader.
 * Another example, you can't use java.lang.String.indexOfIgnoreCase because there are no
 * totalcross.lang.String.indexOfIgnoreCase method. Trying to use a class or method from the java.lang package
 * that has no correspondence with totalcross.lang will make the tc.Deploy program to abort, informing
 * where the problem occured. A good idea is to always refer to this javadoc to know what is and what isn't
 * available.
