## How TotalCross works?
![Usage flow](https://i.imgur.com/Df3NGui.png)

The developer can use Kotlin or Java to create applications using TotalCross Java API which provides rich GUI components.  The application source code is then compiled resulting in the ByteCode Java, which is converted to our TotalCross Optimized Bytecode, packaged and distributed for the platforms the user specified which can be window and Linux desktop, iOS, Android and Linux arm.

## What is inside this repository?
O TotalCross SDK is comprised by two main components:

* TotalCross Java API -  It is the combination of several apis such as GUI components, database and GPIO to create a single more robust API that guarantees quality and support in application development
* TCVM. - The heart of totalcross sdk is present our virtual machine, originally idealized in a master's thesis, and already built and improved over 10 years. It's log-based (Java) architecture, bytecode "itself with its own folders" for the most frequent and implemented **almost 100% with C guarantees performance equivalent to native development**.

## Community
The TotalCross's big dream is to build a large and supportive community of enthusiastic mobile and embedded developers. You can be part of the [telegram](https://t.me/totalcrosscommunity) and here on [GitHub](https://github.com/totalcross/totalcross).

    * Create support for maps;
    * Create customize widgets on camera.
* Improving the TC Java API:
    * Adding API port for Python.
* Improving a TC VM 
    * Create support for external and native libraries.
* Interacting in the [issues repository](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/issues);
    * Report and fixes new bugs;
    * Responding issues report;
    * Suggest and vote on new features.
