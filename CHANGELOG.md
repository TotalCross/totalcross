# TotalCross Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 6.1.1 - October 2020
Hello! This minor release has as main objective:
- **Static SDL2** - Brings it back to work properly on Angstrom for target Linux ARM;
- **Display env-vars** - Configurable displays bounds;
- **`SSLSocketFactory`** - Change `SSLSocketFactory` to always yield a `SSLSocket`;
- **Fixes** - Minor bug fixes :wrench:.

Join our [community on the telegram](https://t.me/totalcrosscommunity) to give feedback about this release!

### Static SDL2

SDL is now statically linked for Linux arm32v7. Some very simple systems do not have the possibility of installing SDL2 in an easy way. On Angström-type systems this required a certain kludge exporting the path to extern `.so` with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-.so>`. We didn't want it to be hard, that's why the change!

### Display env-vars
We now introduce 3 environment variables for execution. Since we do not have an automatic viewport they need to be set up they are:
|     | TC_WIDTH  | TC_HEIGHT  | TC_FULLSCREEN  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Description  | Size of `width` in pixels  | Size of `height` in pixels  | Only do something when comes to `false` or `0` | 
| Values  |  int | int  | bool | 

You can use them as follows for Linux and Linux ARM platforms:

```bash
$ TC_WIDTH=1280 TC_HEIGHT=720 TC_FULLSCREEN=false ./Launcher MyApp
```
When the fullscreen is deactivated the TC is opened in a window and its logic like:
```cpp
width -= width*0.09;
height -= height*0.09;
```
That should change soon. See more in #99.

>The syntax #\<number\> is related to pull request in GitHub repository.

### `SSLSocketFactory`
Should always yields a `SSLSocket` when in `SSLSocketFactory`. As
`SSLSocketFactory` extends `SocketFactory` and does not override the
`createSocket(String, int)` method, and calls from super classe. As
`SocketFactory` yields plain sockets...

This fix just delegates to `createSocket(String, int, int)` passing the default
`Socket.DEFAULT_OPEN_TIMEOUT` as the open timeout argument. Maybe it should be
better to call `new SSLSocket(String, int)`, but this constructor does not
exists yet. See more in #122.

> Thanks **@jeffque** :smiley:!

### Fixes
Corrections were made:
- Launch args not being parsed, i.e., ex. `/density` #94;
- SDL didn't work properly in systems without libSDL2-dev, `CreateRenderer()` bug #99;
- SDL use `SDL_Surface` instead of `SDL_Renderer` when hardware accelerated graphics is not available;
- iOS: Update `youtube-ios-player-helper` from 0.0.16 to 1.0.2. This is required because UIWebView, a component used by this dependency, is deprecated resulting the error ITMS-90809 when uploading the app for the app store;
- iOS: fix missing icon files when generating;
- Remove some Sun private libraries are not guaranteed to be available to any JDK besides
the Oracle JDK 8 or previous;
- Fix `AnonymousUserData` usage;
- `StringBuffer` adds missing `CharSequence` constructor.


## 6.1.0 - July 2020
Welcome to the July 2020 release (version 6.1.0). We hope you enjoy the updates in this version. The key highlights are:
  - **Maven plugin new version** - your pom.xml file should change;
  - **KnowCode Compatibility** - It is now possible to run Android XMLs Layouts on Linux Arm;
  - **Virtual Keyboard** - New look and animations;
  - **Using external applications** - Through the runtime.exec method;
  - **Anonymous user statistics** - There is now an option to contribute by sending anonymous data;
  - **Changing the SDL implementation** - Removing the SDL code from within the TotalCross SDK and changing the static to dynamic link.

### Maven plugin new version
After the latest *Language Support for Java* extension updates, some systems had compatibility issues with Java 11. We launched a new version of the TotalCross maven plugin to solve them, the *1.1.6*. You must change the following line:
```xml
...

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.totalcross</groupId>
  <artifactId>totalcross-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <!-- This line: -->
  <version>1.1.6</version>
  <configuration>
    <name>${project.name}</name>
    <platforms>
    
...
```
### KnowCode compatibility
In this version, a *name tag was added to ContentHandler* (Pull request [#20](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/20)), making it possible for [KnowCode](https://github.com/totalcross/KnowCodeXML), a tool that uses a neural network, to convert [interface images to XML and TotalCross, allowing it to run on Linux Arm](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/linux-arm-ui) with the **same performance** as an application built directly with the TotalCross SDK.

### Virtual Keyboard
In this milestone some improvements were implemented in the keyboard, which are:
- In Linux Arm the virtual keyboard is enabled by default. To disable it just put `Settings.virtualKeyboard = false` in your `MainWindow` class; 
- In order to improve performance and make the design cleaner, the *ripple effect* animation on the keyboard buttons was removed;
- In order to obtain more effective responsiveness, the calculations of width and height were changed, leaving it less dependent on absolute values;
- To make the interface richer, *sliding animation* was added to the *popup* and *unpopup* of the virtual keyboard. You can see these changes in detail in pull requests [#40](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/40) and [#65](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/65).

In the images below you can see the visual difference:

### External applications
To allow the use of external libraries in the simplest way possible is one of TotalCross goals. There is a [branch in our repository](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/tree/feature/tcni-rebased) called `feature/tcni-rebased` which (still a Proof Of Concept) allows the use of these external libraries

> TCNI is a foreign function interface programming framework that enables TotalCross/Java code running in a Java virtual machine to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages ​​such as C, C ++ and assembly.

But while TCNI is not ready to be launched, we have developed a middle ground **that allows the use of external applications** in TotalCross, through the method `runtime.exec()`. This method creates a new process and executes the command you passed in this new process (Pull request [#21](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/21)). 

For example, create a python script to access a temperature sensor and with the `runtime.exec()` get the return of it, as you can see in this [example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brunoamuniz_android-linux-linuxarm-activity-6686008251059847168-u-Sr):

To better understand how it works using a sample application click [here](https://learn.totalcross.com/documentation/guides/running-c++-applications-with-totalcross).

### Anonymous user statistics:

When TotalCross decided to become a free and open source tool, the decision was made to no longer require an activation key from the user, which was previously necessary to differentiate free users from customers. As this removal would imply resolving a series of errors and making many changes, the team decided to generate an eternal and unlimited key and use it as a default, provisionally, until we resolve some pending issues and can go back to this point and withdraw it for good.

So in 6.1.0 we went back to that and removed the activation key, including the class `register.java`, as you can see in detail in pull request [#53](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/53).

And to better track which users preferences when using the TotalCross SDK, we **set up the SDK to ask if the developer wants to contribute anonymous data** and if the answer is positive, we record parameters for Deploy, timezone, launchers, operating system version and version of TotalCross used.

You can see the details of the implementation in Pull Request [#66](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/66).

### Change in SDL implementation

We chose to remove SDL code from the SDK TotalCross in this version **to improve the build organization** and allow people **to customize the build** of their facilities according to their hardware.

In addition, we changed the SDL link from static to dynamic because: 
- Allows the distribution to have corrections and be used without having to compile the TC again but the guy needs to install the SDL before TotalCross
- Avoids License compliance problems as [FOSSA](https://app.fossa.com/account/login?next=%2F) warns about the SDL license (GPLv3).

For details, see pull requests [#23](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/23), [#24](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/24), and [#68](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/68).

### Other changes:

- Fixed [wrong size returned by `FontMetrics.stringWidth(String s)`](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/50) on devices that use skia with .ttf file type fonts. 
- Fixed [Torizon/Wayland SDL](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross/pull/35) initialization;

## 5.0.0 - 2019-04-15

### Highlights
- TotalCross is now aware of the device's screen pixel density and uses this information to scale UI elements uniformly on different platforms. 
 - The font size is now expressed in scaleable pixels (sp) and will now scale uniformly on different screens. The font size should now be expressed as a constant value or based on `Settings.deviceFontHeight`, but **never** based on the screen's resolution or target platform.

> :information_source: **Existing applications may require adjustments to their font sizes!**

- Improved overrall UI responsiveness and reduced application start time on Android
 - Several `Vm.sleep` calls in the vm had their time reduced by 50% or more, some calls were replaced with `Thread.yield()`
 - On Android and Java, reduced overhead in the event thread to improve UI responsiveness

#### Screen density support
All graphical components can now be scaled to have approximately the same physical height on any screen resolution.

##### Density by OS
- Android and iOS: these devices expose a manufacturer-provided screen density value. On TotalCross 5 applications, this value is retrieved by default and used to ensure consistent component sizes across devices
- Java: based on scale, e.g. /scale 0.5 = density 2.0, you can try different densities on the emulator by changing the scale command line argument
- Win32 and WinCE: Most Windows devices do not natively expose screen density information and, thus, are kept at density 1.0.
To improve the look and feel on smaller screens, we use a density of 0.75 on screens with width or height less than 320
- Other platforms: nothing changed (= density 1.0)

##### Font
The font size is now expressed in scalable pixels (sp), this abstracts away the actual physical dimension (screen pixels) of the font. This way, their actual physical size is calculated based on the screen density. e.g:
A font with size of 20sp with different screen resolutions:
- Density 1.0: actual size 20 pixels
- Density 1.5: actual size 30 pixels
- Density 2.0: actual size 40 pixels
- Density 0.75: actual size 15 pixels
This change shall render TotalCross apps ready for different screen sizes with minimal implementation effort. 

>>>
**Updating for 5.0**

Using Font.getDefaultFontSize is no longer necessary, you may now use constant values and the font size will be adjusted accordingly. 
Applications that tried to “guess” the appropriate font size based on screen resolution may need adjustments.
Applications that used Settings.uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeight should have their graphical components resized more uniformly across different platforms and screen densities.
>>>

##### Density Independent Pixels
Controls may now have their dimensions expressed in density independent pixels units (dp), which are scaled for the screen based on its pixel density. e.g:
```java
// adds Button with height of 20dp
add(new Button("Ok"), RIGHT, BOTTOM, PREFERRED, DP + 20);
```
This is now the preferred way of setting the control’s dimensions.

#### Improved support for animations
We now provide a central update event that controls can register for. This event fires periodically and is meant to be used to drive all animations in the framework.
In comparison to using timer events for animations, this approach uses less CPU and memory, and behaves better under high CPU usage scenarios.

>>>
**Updating for 5.0**

Several classes were updated to use the new update events and the effect on them should be noticeable without any changes. In special, we would like to highlight the  ScrollContainer and the ControlAnimation components. 
Users are encouraged to replace similar uses of threads, sleeps and timer events with update events.
>>>

#### Smoother scrolling
The ScrollContainer and the Flick components were updated to provide smoother and more precise scrolling. The changes include the usage of quadratic easing animation and exponential decay.
The Flick also factors in the screen’s pixel density and offers the user the option of tuning the flick acceleration.
Lastly, Flick also supports consecutive drags to increase the scrolling speed.

>>>
**Updating for 5.0**

Most of the changes made are transparent to the user, but there were some breaking changes on Flick. User may have to remove the usage of fields that are no longer available.
>>>

#### Icon control
With the new Icon control it’s easier to add beautiful and meaningful icons to your application.

This is now the preferred way of adding icons to your application and should be favored over image files. One major reason to favor icon font sets over images is that they are highly scalable and will look sharp in any resolution while using only a fraction of the system resources an image would use.
Material Icons are already bundled with the sdk and the IconType interface may be used to implement more font sets.

#### Alpha support for Labels and Icons
It’s now possible to change the opacity of text and icons within Label or Icon controls. This is a key feature to design beautiful applications, as it allows text to remain legible over any background color.
Transparent status bar

Currently only supported on Android, but iOS support will be ready soon.

#### Navigation Drawer
All the previously listed changes were put in use to futher develop the SideMenuContainer, complying with the Navigation Drawer pattern defined by the Material Design guidelines (https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigation-drawer.html):
- Action bar height is now 20 dp
- Bar title and menu items using the Roboto Medium font (when available)
- Labels and icons now use the correct font size, weight and opacity
- Keylines and margins are respected both inside and outside the side menu (with a special exception for really small screens)
- Smooth slide-in and out effects, with fade effect during slide removed
- Resting elevation over the content
- Swipe to open support is still in its early stages, but should be functional for most applications
- Adjusts automatically when used with transparent status bar

### Added
- SideMenuContainer.Sub, a collapsible submenu for the navigation drawer
- MaterialWindow, a popup window that slides from the bottom to the top of the screen

### Changed
- Camera: On Android, choosing an image from the Gallery no longer creates a copy of it when not necessary (images from a cloud service still require a local copy) - TotalCross#400
- Java
  - ByteArrayOutputStream: added several missing methods - TotalCross#478
  - System: added method `arraycopy`
  - Charset: method forName now correctly validates the given charset name and may throw `IllegalCharsetNameException`
  - String: added constructor `String(byte[] value, int offset, int count, String encoding)` to allow the creation of strings with a given supported enconding
 
### Deprecated

### Changes
- Updated version of the Bouncy Castle dependency
- On Java, Settings.appPath is now initialized even if the Launcher isn't executed - TotalCross#165
- Launcher
  - The Launcher (simulator) can no longer be used without an activation key
- Deploy
  - Check paths from pkg file and throw more meaningful error message when a path is invalid
  - Print Deploy exceptions on System.err instead of System.out and using the default stack trace output
- Whiteboard
  - No longer recreates the content image when repositioned - TotalCross#187, TotalCross#196
- ListBox
  - Deprecated method `add(Object[] moreItems, int startAt, int size)` as it was redundant and more confusing than helpful
- ComboBox
  - Deprecated method `add(Object[] moreItems, int startAt, int size)` as it was redundant and more confusing than helpful
- Radio
  - Added feature autosplit - TotalCross#180

### Added
- EscPosPrintStream - New API which supports several ESC/POS printer commands - refer to the class documentation and samples for more information
- Notification and NotificatonManager - Allows the creation and presentation of local notifications to the user, currently implemented for Android, iOS and Java.
- ImageLoader - New class to help managing image resources, especially jpeg images. Currently no caching is done by the class.
- Image
  - Added static methods `Image.getJpegScaled` and `Image.getJpegBestFit` to load jpeg files using fast IDCT scale, more about this [here](http://jpegclub.org/djpeg/)
- Java
  - Added classes ByteArrayOutputStream and UncheckedIOException 
  - Added classes Charset and UnsupportedCharsetException, added also `String.getBytes(Charset)`
- Added Cp437CharacterConverter, which supports encoding and decoding characters using the CP-437 charset (also known as IBM437, windows-437, among others). Especifically added to be used with EscPosPrintStream to properly support writing text to Leopardo A7.
- Convert
  - Added method `charsetForName(String name)`, which returns one of the registered charsets available
  - Added method `registerCharacterConverter(AbstractCharacterConverter characterConverter)`, which allows users to create and registers their own subclass of AbstractCharacterConverter to support custom encodings
  - Added several aliases to the existing ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 CharacterConverter classes and changed `setDefaultConverter` to be case insensitive and support any of listed aliases.

> The existing CharacterConverter class and subclasses were changed to extend AbstractCharacterConverter, which extends Charset. The actual support to Java Charset is almost none, the main goal is to allow the usage `String.getBytes(Charset)` with the existing CharacterConverter and let users encode strings with different charsets without changing the charset used by the rest of the application through Convert.setDefaultConverter.

### Deprecated
- ListBox
  - Deprecated method `add(Object[] moreItems, int startAt, int size)` as it was redundant and more confusing than helpful
- ComboBox
  - Deprecated method `add(Object[] moreItems, int startAt, int size)` as it was redundant and more confusing than helpful

### Known issues
- iOS
  - Applications signed for enterprise distribution cannot run on iOS 12 - apparently it fails to validate the certification chain that validates the signed application. It's not clear yet if this was an intended change or a bug, but there's no word from Apple about it yet.
  - Applications signed for distribution through the AppStore cannot be uploaded because of changes on the way image resources are handled starting from iOS 11. We are working on a definite fix for this, in the mean time feel free to contact us to manually package the application for the AppStore. 
- Notification
  - Android lacks support for custom images for notifications, only the default TotalCross logo is supported
  - Notification crashing application on Android - TotalCross#255
- PushButtonGroup
  - The fix for the drag event caused PushButtonGroup to be unclickable on Win32, affecting all dialogs - TotalCross#263

  - The Java implementation is replaced by a native call during the deploy
- `java.util.function.*` functional interfaces of Java 8 to provide a deeper dive into functional programming
  - The project needs to be compiled with Java 8 to works, even if it has been downtargeted by RetroLambda
  - **NOTE**: no default methods nor static methods yet
- Wish to add your dependencies dynamically? Take a look at [`tc-compiler-help`](https://github.com/TotalCross/tc-compiler-help)
  - The file `all.pkg` is dynamically updated with your dependencies and restored to it's original state
  - See build examples:
    1. Build to multiple platforms [here](https://github.com/TotalCross/IFoodUI/blob/c0e96ade3d24539fb2e96cae2637989c6aea5418/src/main/java/tc/samples/like/ifood/IFoodCompile.java#L12)
    1. Must compile with dependenceis `magical-utils`, `tc-utilities` and `tc-components` [here](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross-big-file/blob/master/src/main/java/com/totalcross/sample/bigfile/BigFileCompile.java#L11)

  - It also warns _Resource leak_ when the compiler detects that you are not releasing a opened resource

## 3.44.3483 - 2017-07-17

### Highlights
- Launcher no longer requires an activation key to run, instead it shows a dismissible popup to input the activation key to be stored on the user's AppData system equivalent directory.
- The stored activation key is used by default for both Launcher and Deploy if the activation key is not provided as a command line argument.

### Fixed
- `AccordionContainer.collapseAll` not using `showAnimation` when set to false.
- AccordionContainer expand/collapse not resizing the parent window.
- Fixed not being able to set focus to a Window under the current top one.

 - On iOS, this method has a native implementation that does not require loading the image on memory, greatly improving performance and memory consumption.
 - On every other platform this method will still load the image on memory to perform the resize, but it should still be preferred over other resize methods as we intend to also add native implementation for other platforms in the future.
- Added `Toast.show(final String message, final int delay, final Window parentWindow)`, where you can pass the window where the tooltip will be shown.
