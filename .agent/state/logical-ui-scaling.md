# Logical UI scaling execution state

Rewrite this file instead of appending. It is the first read when resuming.

## Base and Branch

- Observed master at plan authoring:
  `d480df074e7fb6f5a32dfcc2f1f30c3949095e73`
- Actual fetched base: `d480df074e7fb6f5a32dfcc2f1f30c3949095e73`.
- Worktree: `/Users/flsobral/repos/totalcross-logical-ui`.
- Branch: `feat/logical-ui-scaling`.
- Last logical commit: none.

## Active Milestone

Milestone 1: introduce the logical API and layout contract.

## Active Slice

Read the Milestone 1 API design and make the smallest coherent logical-layout
contract change with focused tests.

## Next Concrete Action

Read `.agent/design/logical-ui-scaling-api.md` in full, then inspect only its
named source files and existing test layout.

## Files to Read Now

- `.agent/logical-ui-scaling-execplan.md`, Milestone 1 only.
- `.agent/design/logical-ui-scaling-api.md`.

Do not read all design guides yet.

## Focused Validation Completed

- `git fetch origin master` and isolated worktree creation: passed.
- Static baseline audit: passed. `Launcher.getFont`, Skia text drawing, and
  Skia metric width paths multiply font size by `Settings.screenDensity`.

## Deferred Validation

All implementation, renderer, platform, and DANFE validation remains deferred
until its corresponding milestone.

## Active Decisions

- Start from current `origin/master`.
- Ignore source changes from earlier plans in this session.
- Use `double` for fractional API and implementation calculations.
- Do not modify the deployer.
- Keep every new file below 20 KiB and approximately 600 lines.

## Blockers

None recorded.

## Deliberately Out of Scope

- unrelated renderer refactors;
- packaging or release changes not required by this API;
- importing earlier implementation patches;
- closing or updating issue #433 without explicit user instruction.

## Resume Command

cd /Users/flsobral/repos/totalcross-logical-ui
sed -n '1,260p' .agent/design/logical-ui-scaling-api.md
